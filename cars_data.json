I've had one since 2002, fairly low mileage (110K). Except for minor problems with both front and back calipers sticking up, it just keeps on going (no oil consumption, original clutch, even original exhaust!) and with still-super handling and high performance too. (E.g. to knock your socks off, drop down into 3rd at 60 and hit the pedal.) If you can find one, buy it!

Very comfortable leather seats, seat warmers, nice stereo, smooth shifting and a blast to drive. One owner well taken care of and under a 100 thousand miles are tough to find but are out there. Generally are between 5 and 7 thousand for a car that was 32 thousand new. Considering that they can go 300 K miles you are getting a car with 2/3 its life left for 1/4 of the original price. The automatics had big problems so the the 6 speed are being overlooked. Total 2003 6 speed production was 3311, yes thirty three hundred eleven!.

Replaced one HID headlight ballast & bulb, both hood openers & brake pads myself. Dealers replaced the timing belt, water pump & spark plugs all 3 times. I change oil & filter religiously every 5K miles with Mobil-1 5-20 & Fram. Some annoyances: Weak seat belt retractor often leaves belt hanging out the door when exiting. Acura mechanic said he couldn't do anything but clean the pillar loop. Trunk lid springs aren't strong enough because of the extra weight of the rear wing. If you don't watch it, a gentle wind will blow the lid down on your head. Paper thin paint. Had front bumper repainted. Headlight lenses get cloudy too soon after polishing. Wish someone made glass replacements. Still the best car I ever owned. Never had a vehicle go this far without the AC needing service.

Love the high-revving nature and silky smooth sound of the 3.2 VTEC, just drop down a gear and in a blink it's well past any traffic and into 3 digit speeds. Classy is the word to describe it's style and sound, not look-at-me boy-racer noisy. Despite some front drive understeer at the limit it feels light on its feet handling sharply with lightning quick and well weighted steering. Got 40K on oem MXM4s and my newer Pilot Exalto A/S are quieter and grippier. It would be the absolute perfect car if it were rwd, but as is this baby's a beast in the snow. Bose sound is outstanding! Love the interior layout with sloping, low dash, low beltline, and lots of glass/visibility compared to today's tank-like styles that have you looking through slits for windows. Incredibly comfortable leather seats which hug you in the twisties like none other. This car is so well balanced with room, quiet comfort, handling, and gobs of power. An everyday, all-weather smile inducer. I keep an eye on the automotive scene looking for something to replace it someday, but nothing new has the same blend of all the Type-S's qualities in one package, especially from Acura whose recent styling direction has been abominable. I may just keep it forever."

It will take some digging but the 6 speed is where it?s at! Now, if you can find the 6 speed (only in the Type S and in the 2003 model) you have a super sleeper car that will dust most cars in its price range from stoplight to stoplight! I have personally put a few 3 series BMW's in their place. Outside of the 350z, M3, G35 or the newer Mustangs you should not have a problem getting the best of the other drivers. Another positive is there are not many on the road. It?s a smooth shifter and about the right amount of power to have fun on the on ramp and not get into too much trouble. Standard options are a laundry list of high end must haves. I recommend the touch screen Nav system if you can find it, only 800 of these made with the 6 speed but I got one! Because of the automatic transmission stigma you can get a really great deal on this car. Car is great on the highway as the bucket seats wrap around you and there is more than enough room in the back for two adults (provided they don?t play for the Knicks). Bose in dash 6 disc CD player has tons of power and clarity. Heated seats are a nice bonus in the winter (my girls friend loves this option) Negatives. Repairs are a bit more expensive than the usual Honda but that is the price of swimming in the deep end of the pool. Compared to BMW, Lexus etc. you will spend a lot less in the long run. Headlights are expensive, ($100 a pop) and these cars tend to have a problem with the head light assembly ($500). I test drove 5 of these and they all tend to drift a bit to the right, small concession really but it is something that I have noticed. Clutch repair is also very expensive (quotes from $700 to $2000) but I found a mechanic that works well on Acura?s for a fair price. I have read reviews that these things tear up brake rotors but I have not experienced that problem. I am not in love with the exterior styling but you can do small things to improve it such as a slightly lower tire profile and I also removed the Acura decals to give it a custom look. All in all the positives greatly out weigh the negatives and you can really pick up a super fun and comfortable ride for a great price. Have fun! Just remember no automatic transmissions!"

Engine - fantastic performance and exceptional over the road mileage (26 to 27 always) and around 20 in city driving. Tranny - mine is a 6sp manual and it's flawless. At 145K I'm still on the original clutch. Brakes - the car's only weaker point. The brakes are a little under engineered for the car's weight and power. I upgraded to Brembo front rotors with aftermarket pads and it helped a lot. Handling - well, duh, it's a pretty heavy front wheel drive so it's not sports car agile, but will run with 90% of what is on the road. Interior - well appointed and comfotable with more standard \"accessories\" than most new cars today. Reliability - fantastic. I actually had a real repair about 4 months ago. None other than standard maintenance items until then. Well, one. The CD player is not working. The radio/cd player/tape player is actually an Alpine unit, only the speakers are Bose, and there have been issues with it. I would, without qualification, reccomend this car to anyone. It's just a real shame that Acura has gone amother route with their model line up."

I am getting a bit older now and prefer some practicality and luxury in a daily-driver. This car delivers boatloads of both at an excellent value, without sacraficing performance. The list of luxuries is long, some of my favorites are the power, heated leather seats. I truly think they could be the most comfortable seats ever made in a car under $80K in price. I also love how the passenger mirror tilts down when the car is in reverse so one can park carefully as to not damage the beautiful 17\" wheels. Performance-wise, this car is no slouch. The CL-S can easily keep up with brand new cars in its class despite being 7 years old. The engine note is throaty at high revs, as the dual-stage air induction system allows more air into the engine, and you feel a surge of power thanks to VTEC technology. This car is rock-solid at 130mph and still pulling. The sport-tuned suspension delivers a smooth ride despite the fact that it was designed to handle, and it does handle well. My only complaint is slight understeer, probably due to the fact that the vehicle is front-heavy, but this is only noticeable when pushing it. Steering feels natural and responsive. One concern I have is with the automatic transmission which shifts a little rough. There have been reports that these do break, but with 72K miles on the car there is no sign of anything irregular. VSA (Vehicle Stability Assist) is a good feature, especially when driving in the rain. Performance is not good in the snow, however, as the tires are not designd for it. For a coupe, this car is practical. It can fit 4 adults but I feel bad for the folks in the back seat. I do not have kids, but I suspect they'd be more than comfortable back there. Trunk space is plentiful. The Bose sound system with in-dash 6 cd changer and cassette deck is above average for sure. I miss my AUX jack from my last stereo, though. Overall, I like the fact that these cars were not produced in high numbers, so you don't see a million on the road. I feel like I am driving a unique car with classy styling. It is a performer with every luxury a purist like myself would ever need (remember, I started with Acura Integras) and more. The 2003 example is actually unique to only that year, then Acura ceased production of the CL all together. If you can get your hands on one of these cars with low-mileage that's been looked after, buy it!"

(this beats even old EPA estimates due to my \"creative hyper-mileage\" driving such as coasting, keeping rpm's 2500 or lower (72 mph in 6th), and of course keeping the lead out of my right foot! Even before doing this I ave. 25-26+. Best mileage on long trip is 32! I know, hard to believe to get this with a 5 year old 260 horsepower 3400 lb sport / luxery coupe! This w/ stock rubber; plan to experiment with taller tires with which the close ratio gearing and wide power band should handle well. Have heard A/T will not do this good on mileage, but neither will many under powered 4 cyl's! The engine gets an A, but the 6 sp. tranny gets an A++. I doubt a Porsche, Ferrari or any other 6 figure exotic could shift any smoother or more positive. NO problems with clutch (orig.) or trans, hooks up nice, bullet-proof! Handleing was rated excellent in '03 by Car & Driver, \"best front driver ever\". Fact: Tested head to head in '02, the CL-S actually beat a BMW 330 CI on test laps, lateral G's, and matched it in performance! Mine is lowered a bit, enhanceing this further, and giving it a custom look. One other bonus: I'm a road & mountain biker. Even my tall carbon road frame at 61 cm, wheels & gear fit snugly and securely in the abundant trunk with room to spare. Show me another coupe, under 6 sec to 60, that DOES ALL THIS! Acura discontinued this model in '03, in favor of producing more SUV's. In light of $4.75 gasoline, was this a big mistake or what?! Nissan has no problem selling their hot-rod Altima's; the CL-S, even at 5 yrs old not only out-classes an Altima hands-down, but match's the 3.5 SE & SE-R in performance. Acura's loss, no problem, makes my '03 more of A CLASSIC! While initial quality and styleing ratings were not tops, check out the JD Power 3 year quality survey, completed a year after I bought the car in '06; Yep, CL named first place in the \"Entry Premium\" car class. \"Sometimes a classic just takes a while to grow on you.\""

The Type S includes a beautiful, backlit dash, luxurious all-leather interior, and 260 hp. With heated seats and traction control it's also a great winter car. I do have two complaints: first, my transmission failed in 2009 when the car had just under 40k miles (I live within 5 miles of my work). I never want to hear that sound again. Brought it into the dealership and they gave me a free transmission, but apparently about a month later the repair would have cost me over $5000. Second, the paint is poor quality. I have several areas of \"bubbling\" and fade. Still, at under 50k miles as of summer 2010 I think I'll just have the car repainted. I'll likely drive my CL until Acura produces a similar high end coupe."

The windows give wonderful all-around visibility. The blind spot people mentioned is that the mirrors are very large. Other than this, its a great car and we continue to enjoy it everyday. We had the prior CL bodystyle, 1998, before this CL. The mirrors are not a problem on the 97-99 CL models. Better design. There was no problem with anything on that model.

Great Bose sound system too. The car has been absolutely trouble free - except for the well known transmission issues. Acura first doubled the transmission warranty to 100,000 miles, and did a recall to improve lubrication flow. When my car started to have mild transmission symptoms, Acura replaced the transmission at 105,000 miles with no argument, even though the warranty had expired. In 24 years my wife and I have had 2 Hondas and 2 Acuras. We kept each of them for at least 8 years and 110,000 miles.

No other vehicle comes close to giving you all those features anywhere near it's price. The reliabilty has been outstanding and people stare everywhere I go. The Type S is well worth the extra money. Cons: Well known transmission problems. I have had the recall done and will keep my fingers crossed. Also, the paint does seem to chip easily. Overall, it is an outstanding car. It's power, features, styling, and reliability are top notch and I am now an Acura customer for life."

Except for the odd issue, like starter, alternator, brakes, it hasn't given me any issues. I have done some custom suspension work on it as well as a cold air intake and chip to improve performance, and it hasn't disappointed. Honda was smart enough to introduce VTEC (variable valve timing) much earlier, in 1993 or '97 I believe, before any other manufacturers, like the Domestics, thus the fuel economy has been there and still is from the beginning. I average, 32 mpg or better any day, on a 14 yo car. I dare anyone to compare. Honda also didn't try to trick us, like the Domestics, into buying cars that don't actually get what they say, or misusing the highway mileage as the average. I am happy, I have to part with it because I would like something newer, otherwise it has been a great, fun car, with the little luxuries that Acura affords."

So I bought this vehicle used about 8 years ago for around $3000, in good running condition, the tires had a bit of a flat spot on them from sitting in the lot, but nothing to worry about. Since then, I've replaced my fair share of hardware. The battery and alternator were among the first issues, followed by the EGR valve, computer, and at one point I thought I was going to need to do transmission work, but it sorted itself out... somehow.. more on that later. The little things constantly break. The false wood trim is cracked on the doors, the radio no longer functions, the clock doesnt work, the passenger door handle doesnt operate from the inside or outside, the rear windshield de-icing button does little more than occupy space in the center control panel, the shift handle dislodged itself from the stick and vomited its spring loaded components all over my interior, the cigarette lighter socket came apart while I was unplugging a GPS and actually lit my carpet on fire while I was going down the interstate. So why the positive rating? This car has not stranded me. The powertrain, you know, the expensive bits? Thats all fine and showing no signs of failing. I tore the oilpan and mistakenly drove it BONE DRY on oil and when the motor was acting sluggish, I discovered this and added 4 quarts of oil and it kept going like nothing was wrong. Look, if you're even looking at buying this car, you arent in the market for luxury and all the bells and whistles anymore. Its 20 years old. If you want to get from A to B every day, this is your vehicle. I've been looking at new cars recently, but I'm going to have a hard time giving up such a die-hard vehicle. Bravo Acura, bravo."

I bought this Acura with around 70,000 miles on it...it currently has 160,000 miles now, and is just as strong as its ever been. I've seen many reports of 97 models still running great in the 300k+ range. Its been as trouble free as our 2002 Accord. Replaced window motor, and brakes once. Keep the oil changed in these CLs and they'll drive forever. It has the reliabilty of any typical Honda, the luxury of a Lexus, the comfort of a lazy-boy and plenty of power, which we all like. The seats are roomy, and 2 adults can sit in the back without being too cramped. The Bose sound system has a decent quality sound. The heated seats are a plus during the cold months. The 200 HP Vtech is considerably quick and always fun to drive although stepping on the pedal comes at a price. Unlike the Accords and Civics, it doesnt get the best MPG. Didnt take long to notice this difference. Cant think of alot of changes I'd make except of course a 5-speed transmission and a more sporty exterior design. I'm thankful mine came with a spoiler. Without one these, the body style is somewhat bland to look at."

Have even been a passenger in the back seat for a long trip or two, and it really does fit 2 adults comfortably. Gas mileage is terrific. On long trips it averages 30 mpg, around town it's 25 mpg. Takes regular gas - a treat when the prices start rising. With a big trunk & plenty of room for storing \"stuff\" in the doors, behind the seats, the center armrest, etc., if you spend a lot of time in your car - this is a great choice. This car replaced the 1991 Integra I'd bought new and had for 150,000 miles. Acura/Honda makes a great product."

              "review_text": "Before purchasing this car, I did a TON of reading both professional and consumer reviews as well as watching YouTube review videos. Some professional reviewers get behind the wheel, floor the gas pedal, and then say it's noisy and not fast enough. But the truth is most drivers don't floor the gas in everyday driving. For a driver like myself going to work every day in a normal commute I found the car to be very quick and it also gives a quiet ride! The transmission and engine work very well together for an incredibly smooth driving experience, and both have proven long term reliability. The styling is great, and the fit and finish is quality. It's a very solid feeling car and mine has absolutely no squeaks or rattles. The ELS stereo system with surround sound blows me away and it's the best sound system I've ever heard in a car. The lower touch screen is solely dedicated to the sound system with integrated pandora capability as well as XM radio. The upper screen is dedicated to navigation as well as apple car play and android auto. Reviewers like to complain about the dual screen set up, but I think it's great! My one and only complaint about this car is that the navigation is very dated looking, but hey it works well anyway. The best part about this car is no doubt the value for the money. Compare it to other premium brands and you will pay thousands more, and you really cannot compared it to a non premium model such as a civic because it's truly a cut above in fit and finish. In a way it's in a class all by itself. Also great is that the cost of repair and normal maintenance is nowhere near what you will pay for other premium brands. So all in all I know I made a great decision in buying the ILX and look forward to driving this fun car for many years to come."

              "review_text": "As you may or may not know, the ILX, even the 2020 model, shares most of its basic engineering from the 2012-2015 Honda Civic. While Acura has done a nice job of keeping the styling and technology as fresh as they can, in many ways the car still feels very much like a product of its time. In many respects, I think that's a great thing. ILX is powered by a large-displacement four-cylinder engine that delivers great mid- and upper-range power, which is something you just don't get on the tiny turbocharged motors on most rivals. There's also no engine idle stop/start function to annoy you as you sit in traffic. Handling is excellent, with great steering feel and grip in turns. The climate controls couldn't be simpler to operate, and the heated seats are governed by mechanical switches as opposed to pushbuttons or, worse, the infotainment system. Speaking of infotainment, this is one area where ILX could use an update. The redundant dual-screen arrangement can be somewhat confusing. The built-in navigation system, which is part of the optional Technology Package, is very antiquated. Fortunately, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are available, though you must purchase the somewhat costly Premium Package to get them. Using CarPlay with the dashboard control knob isn't terrible, but it is far less elegant than in other cars. Voice control works well. Passenger and cargo room will be suitable for most, though overall space is less than other modern compact-class cars. Base ILX models have leatherette upholstery that looks and feels a lot like genuine leather. To get the real stuff, you need the Premium Package. Ordering it opens up access to the A-Spec package that includes a number of upgrades, which I think really enhance the car's looks. You can even choose a red leather interior, which is such a refreshing change from the usual black, gray, and brown, that it's what ultimately sold me on the car. Now my ownership experience hasn't been all sunshine and rainbows. Less than two months in, and I started hearing a clunking/popping sound when driving at low speeds. My dealer was able to trace the noise to a faulty strut, which required replacement of the entire shock absorber assembly. Naturally, this was done under warranty. While my experience with the service department was great, I'm more than a bit annoyed that such a part failed on a car derived from another with an otherwise excellent reputation for reliability. For now, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and believe that the strut was faulty from the factory, but I can't in good conscience rate the ILX any higher than average in this category. Put it this way: My \"new\" Acura has experience more mechanical failures than my wife's 2016 Honda CR-V, a vehicle that, as of this writing, has literally 30 times more miles on it. Still, I really do like this car and would recommend it to folks who want something that's both fun to drive and different than what you'll find elsewhere in the market."

Obviously ILX doesn't offer roomy cabin as mush as Accord but it wasn't much important for me. Sitting position is very higher in ILX rather than Accord and mirrors are positioned perfectly and visibility is gorgeous. Cabin noise is similar with Accord and even little less. It delivers smooth ride with comfortable suspension and seats despite of 18\" rims. Its not stiffer as Accord but handles very well.8 Speed Dual Clutch works pretty quick and responds your reactions immediately. Acceleration is also much faster than my expectation and to be honest I wasn't expecting this much peppy because of non-turbo engine. So Thanks to 8 Speed Dual Clutch to play big role of the performance result. A-Spec comes with 225/40/18\" Continental Tires while Premium offers 215/45/17 Michelin Tires. If you need big trunk, unfortunately ILX doesn't offer too much room in trunk. Legroom is enough for till 6' persons but for taller persons i cannot guarantee. Sunroof comes with standard size. LED headlight works perfectly and arranging level itself based on road conditions. Adaptive Cruse Control works superb with front car adjustable following distance. Line Keeping Assist also work combine with ACC without making you stressful. As a result, If you are looking for Small Sporty Sedan which offers good performance and around 28/32 mpg/gallon in common usage, comfortable smooth ride but also feel peppy once you want ILX is one of the best choose with it's pricing. If you want to go with Audi A3, Lexus IS300 or Mercedes A-Class, you should accept to pay much more money + maintenance fees + more loose of value (except Lexus) when you resell."

Some were a bit smaller and some were somewhat larger than the Acura ILX. However all were more expensive to lease . The very well appointed 19 Acura ILX A-Spec Tec is quick, handles skillfully and has precise firm steering. The looks, interior and exterior impress me also. Crazy thing is the MSRP for my loaded car is around 32/33K. That is less than the starting price for the base cars in the category. The very worst drive is the Benz CLA and this has less standard features and cost more than my loaded ILX. The other cars drive well, but are far more expensive for less equipment. The 2019 Acura ILX is extremely fun to drive and reliable. What more can I ask for?"

We test drove a 2017 Civic which as really nicer than I ever remember the Civic to be but somehow did not have the refined aura as the ILX. ILX gave good enough performance, ride, features, comfort and quiet to make it definitely a car that I would be happy to own. And was a better deal than the Civic. Hard to get a deal on a highly desired car as the 2017 Civic. We previously owned a 2015 TLX which clearly outperforms the ILX in every way but honestly it was TOO much car for us. So the ILX fit the bill, better on the budget and we still get that luxury feel and performance but not as intensely as we did from the TLX. It would be safe to say the ILX is a scaled down version of the TLX."

I am not sure if it's just my car, but I can hear the \"tonk\" noise coming from the engine bay (tonk.. tonk.. tonk..) every time I have the car in neutral of park. 2. When I step on the gas pedal, I have to ever so gently use my great toe so the car wont suddenly accelerate. It's fine if I want to quickly go from a starting line, but it gets so irritating that I have to work on how the car would smoothly accelerate coming from a stop sign/light. 3. I feel like I always have to wait for 2-3sec before the gear kicks in. First start in the morning or engine cools down, coming from Park to Drive, I find myself waiting for that gear to kick in. Otherwise, I have this loud revving, and sudden acceleration. Reverse to Drive or vice versa, on a slope, the car does not have that slow roll. Instead, it rolls you to the opposite direction since the gear did not kick in yet. 4. Infotainment system. Why do I always have to wait for the system to finish saying \" After the beep, say the number you would like to call.\" every time I use the assistant? Why do I have to wait 2-3 sec for the next song to play for my next song to play when I press skip. Why cant I connect my Android device through the USB port? Why does it download my contacts and not display the name of the person calling? Why to do I have to go to the process of pressing Select, then press Speed Dial, then press Recent Calls, then select the contact? Why cant I just press the Call Button and select the contact I want to call and make the call. 5. Wipers does not respond after a gap in between spray washing. It stops working. Water is sprayed on my windshield the first time- wiper automatically wipes. I pause, spray my wind shield again, it stops wiping. ALL THESE SMALL THINGS SHOULD NOT BE PRESENT IN A LUXURY CAR, Even if it is just entry level."

Coming from a Honda civic 2017, I can say this car although slightly dated in the inside, feels loads more powerful and comfortable. With seats that hug your body, giving you one of the most comfortable seats out of any car period. The ride itself is great too, although a tad stiff, which in it's self gives it good handling and corning in return. The only big con is the interior is a little dated compared to newer cars, so not a whole lot of smart phone integration besides aux, usb, or Bluetooth, although this means less issues with electrical issues like my old Honda had. Overall I couldn't recommend this car enough, as when buying used it is far cheaper and better than comparative civic models like the ext or si."

              "review_text": "Background: I'm an accountant in my 40s, and I've owned a 1995 Honda Prelude, 2001 Lexus IS 300, and 2013 Scion FR-S. For me driving is not just transportation, it's an experience, and you can see I like sporty cars. After driving the FR-S for three years (loved it!) I wanted to get back to a sports sedan similar to my old IS 300, because my kids are getting bigger, and the FR-S was built for twisty mountain roads, not much fun for commuting. I set my sights on used Lexus IS 350 and Infiniti Q50 (didn't want to play the lottery with German options which MAY be reliable). But when I test drove an IS 350 and Q50, they had a sluggish, big-car feel (too much \"luxury\", not enough \"sport\"). Nothing like the original IS 300, which was very responsive. I dismissed Honda cars outright, because they're front-wheel-drive, but after being disappointed with the Lexus and Infiniti, I test drove an Accord and an Acura ILX. I was very surprised at the handling feel of both, but the smaller ILX really appealed to me, and I found a used A-Spec model. Here's what I love about this car: - Genius 2.4L engine and 8-speed dual-clutch transmission combination makes it far more than an upgraded Civic. Aggressive acceleration in S-Mode (Sport) and snaps off shifts faster than I ever could manually. - Handling disadvantages of a front-wheel-drive only seem to show up in slow , tight corners. Sweepers are a blast! Several hundred pounds lighter than other entry level sport sedans = more responsive. - Sleek body styling can cause non-enthusiasts to miss that it's a sedan. It also goes better with my accountant occupation than a Subaru WRX or Civic Si with boy racer body work and bookshelf spoiler. - 38mpg average on the highway! With a car this quick? That goes against what I know about performance vs fuel efficiency. Again, Lexus and Infiniti have larger engines, more weight, worse mileage. - Decent rear seat leg room for a small sedan, and rear seat folds forward to expand truck space (Lexus and Infiniti models I test drove did not) I've taken the wife and two kids on all-day trips, which makes for a much nicer drive than the minivan. - Seats are comfortable for longer drives, phone integration is good, plastic buttons feel high quality. - Honda reliability. Enough said. How about dislikes: - Load the ILX up with passengers and try to pass another car. You'll immediately be reminded it's a 4-cylinder engine. Larger cars with 6 or 8 cylinder engines will do much better here, but eat a lot more gas the rest of the time. - The ILX can feel a bit loosely sprung over dips and speed bumps, but that keeps the ride appropriately civil for a sedan. It's stiff enough to corner and stop very well. - The steering is over-boosted and doesn't have enough resistance. - A-Spec \"sawblade\" wheels. I tried to like them for 6 months and eventually swapped them out for aftermarket wheels. - This isn't a complaint, but you have to accept that a $33,000 Acura is going to be missing some features you'll find on a $55,000 Lexus. If I had to sum up the ILX, I'd say it's a brilliant compromise that works great for me. If it was more hard core sports sedan, it would be less enjoyable as a daily driver. If it was larger with more comforts, it would be missing the quick reflexes that make it fun to drive more of the time. It scratches my performance itch while working very well with my everyday life."

              "review_text": "I have had this since mid August, 2016, and here is my in-depth review. The car has a solid \"feel\" to it. Climate control is responsive and throttles down once target temperature is about to be reached (auto setting). Mine has the ELS audio system and while it does sound good, it could be better. One, any audio that has been mastered \"hot\", meaning with high levels, the audio sounds as if it's limited (compressed down). That is regardless if you have the volume set low or high. Two, .wav (uncompressed audio) is not supported. It would be nice if it was. Three, some midrange frequencies are accented, particularly around 500 Hz or so. That can make some vocals sound \"honky\". Moving on to the engine and transmission, the engine is fine. The transmission leaves a bit to be desired. It shifts up too quickly. I realize the engineers at Acura programmed it for maximum economy but when you are trying to accelerate to highway speeds, it could give the impression that the car is lacking in power when it actually isn't. Of course, there is sport mode where you can use the paddles and do the shifting yourself but there is no happy medium, like there is with the TLX. Starting from a dead stop will sometimes make the transmission lurch and hiccup (likely a shortcoming of the DCT transmission). Fuel economy can be very good, in particular at highway speeds (60 to 65 mph). I have observed mpg range as high as 45 at 60-65 mph. Mileage drops once you reach 70 mph. I'm rather conservative in my driving style but I'm no slow poke. I tend to average 33 to 37 mpg and my driving is roughly 65% highway; 35% city driving. Wet roads will hamper mpg BIG time, thanks to the wide tires, but I like those wide tires for their cornering prowess. Adaptive cruise control is good and I can tell it has some fine tuning to do. The way it handles speed can be rather abrupt at times. \"False\" highway markings can sometimes trick the road departure sensors, thinking that you are leaving the lane / road when you aren't. I've had the car warn me to \"steer\" the car when I keep the steering wheel perfectly still, with the lane keeping assist switched on. If Acura would have put sensors in the steering wheel to detect grip, that would have been good. The drivers seat is good for long distance driving. Lower back support could be slightly improved though. The navigation system is archaic. For 2016, it was even missing some not so new highways. I wished the head unit had Android auto / Apple Carplay. About the use of Premium fuel: Acura recommends it but it is in NO way required. My car runs 89 octane (mid-grade) unleaded fine. If you have access to ethanol free 91+ octane (premium) gas, give that a try. For me, my mileage went up, as well as the responsiveness of the engine."

The good: The car is no 0-60 speed demon, but it is quite fast (i've gotten it up to almost 140 MPH).The 8 Speed DCT in the car is FANTASTIC! shifts are incredibly fast and smooth and the paddle shifters have immediate response. The engine is a gem, you can get 40+ MPG on the hwy if you set the cruise control around 65(my personal best is 43 MPG). I have the tech pack which gets you goodies like lane keep assist, which will literally drive the car for you like a tesla (theres a button on the steering wheel to activate it and i call it the \"telsa button\"), blind spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, and emergency braking (which has saved me a few times). The ELS audio system i have in my car is quite good, has a decent amount of bass which is hard to come by in small cars. The bad: #1:THERE'S ONLY ONE POWER OUTLET IN THE ENTIRE CAR!!!! i have no idea what the Acura designers were thinking to only include one power outlet... i'm still shocked a 2016 car would come with only 1 outlet. #2: The turning circle is HORRIBLE! i've compared it to my friends cars like a VW GTI and Mazda 3 and my ILX will have to make a 2 point turn in spots where their cars can do it in 1 turn. It's seriously abysmal. #3. i absolutly love the look of the jewel eye headlights but they are dimmer than a standard HID or Halogen bulb, it'd be nice if they were brighter. #4: the seats have no lumbar support adjustment, it'd be nice if they did. #5; The backup camera is terrible at night time, you can't see a thing. I'm going to replace the halogen reverse light bulbs with LEDs and see if that will make a difference. Overall its a great little car, i think its great value for money if you can find a good used one like i did. I basically drive this car like i stole it and have not encountered a single mechanical problem yet!(knock on wood)"

              "review_text": "After selling my Civic Si to pay for my last year of grad school and scooting around in a Fiesta for a few years, I decided to treat myself to my first luxury car. As a Honda fanboy (\"the GTI is better than the Si\" are fighting words, as far as I was concerned), I naturally looked to Acura and the ILX. The ILX seemed to be designed for my demographic, afterall. After a test drive, it reminded me of my Si, and it just felt right to be back in a Honda. So it was an easy decision to make the ILX my first luxury car purchase. But it's not a \"luxury\" car. To be fair, I can't state a definite definition of what a luxury car is. But I am fairly certain that if $20 Wal-Mart seat covers are a vast improvement to the comfort, look, feel, and overall quality of the interior, it's not a luxury car. And I'm equally certain that luxury car's don't use pleather (even if they call it \"premium leatherette\"). The driver's seat is the most painful seat I've ever sat in. It's like they measured where the pressure points were, then wrapped a cord around the seats at those points to cut into your back. After about 30 minutes in the car the seams in the pleather leave welt marks across my back. Then there's the seat belt which pokes into my hip. And the complete lack of headroom eliminates some of the seat configurations that might help alleviate these problems. The stereo is garbage too. There's no base or high end, the USB input rarely works, and when it does it's controls are cumbersome. So I'm using CD's again, like I did in my '98 Civic DX--which came with a stereo that was only slightly inferior to the ILX, but was easily replaced. And there's not much else to speak of regarding the interior beyond the painful pleather seats and garbage stereo. Sure, the seats are heated, which is nice if you live in North Dakota, I guess. And there's a back-up camera--the same one that's standard in the cheapest Honda you can buy--which will come in handy if the seat ruins my back and I can't turn my neck anymore. The engine and transmission aren't bad, too be honest. The transmission is very good, in fact; as good as an automatic can be (though I'd trade it for a 5 speed manual from a 20 year old Honda in a heartbeat). And it feels plenty quick and powerful, more than what is needed for regular driving. But it's not fun. Even in Sport mode, it just feels dull and disconnected. It may be objectively faster and perform better than my old Si, but, for whatever reason, it has none of the fun. Part of that is the steering, which is vague, light, provides no feedback, and gives you no confidence to push it on a windy mountain road. Unfortunately, it still has all the road noise of the Si and then some. My Fiesta was even quieter at highway speeds than this \"luxury\" car. The Fiesta also had a nicer interior, better ride, handling/steering, transmission (because manual), stereo, infotainment system, better dealer experience...pretty much everything but acceleration. If I could serve out the rest of my sentence (lease) in my Fiesta, even paying the same and turning it over at the end, I'd have to think long and hard about it--the only thing stopping me would be the thought of flushing $15 grand down the toilet for the joy of driving an ILX for 6 months, and knowing that it'd be a windfall for Acura...if I kept the ILX, it'd be out of spite. The ILX is, by any reasonable objective or subjective standard, the worst car in its price range. No wonder Acura wants to compare it cars in the higher price range so it can seem like a good value, because it can't hold a candle to the likes of the WRX, GTI, Verano, or even the new Civic, all of which costs less than this poorly conceived disaster. Don't be fooled. Stay away. I know I will. When I can finally dump this car and go looking for my first luxury car for the second time, I won't consider Acura. I'll never buy another Honda product again, not even a lawnmower, and I freaking hate Craftsman. My only hope is that the ILX is as reliable and holds its resale value as well as other Hondas and I can get it out the lease after another 6 months. Otherwise I'll have to drive it into a brick wall to total it, life and limb be damned. But maybe a brain injury or paralysis would be a fair trade for never having to see this mistake in my driveway ever again."

They recommend buying the tlx they said it is a much better car. Corporate Acura told me there was nothing th hey could do to reduce the road noise... there is a u tube video by the lead Acura designers stating that he put advanced noise deafing features in the car to reduce road noise....thats not true....the road noise is horrible...based on how I was treated I will never ever buy another acura...."

It is simple and plain (not boring ) in general and step a little harder on the pedal and its put a smile on your face with a little roar. The transmission i feel is the real hero here. Acura need a lot more dual cluth-auto s in their line up. The only wish would be a better feedback steering experience but its not bad. Its a near perfect daily drive and fits the bill and bang for the buck , considering the competition. Kudos Acura"

I test drove the competition ( Buick Verano,Lexus IS 250, Infiniti Q40, BMW 320, Benz CLA and Audi A-3. While all were more than acceptable, ILX proved to be the winner. Most bang for the buck.

It's roomy inside so you don't feel cramped and it is quiet too. I have been on the road quite a bit and it passes with ease and speeds up great. So considering all that I was looking for and for the cost is just a no-brainer to me since I was looking for affordability and reliability. I hope this helps and if you're considering a 4 door safe luxury car that's reliable then definitely go for this one and take it for a test drive. You won't be disappointed."

The reviews are generally bad to middling for this car and I've found it to be an absolute delight. My last two cars were a 2000 3.2 TL and a 2004 TL which is in perfect condition except for the paint so I gave the TL to my 16 year old daughter and at 56 years old, I was ready to downsize. I will only buy an Acura or a Honda (2012 CRV for my wife) so my choice was this model or a TSX which is not much of a downsize, the styling is plain, and I believe that it will be phased out this year. So I really had no choice and I wanted all the bells and whistles. They say this 150 HP car is too slow and doesn't have a 6 speed tranny (boo hoo) but I find it to be plenty quick enough and I've never cried too hard because it doesn't shift into 6th. Granted, it doesn't blast off like my 270 HP TL but I'm 56 years old and not needing to blast off so much anymore. (My 16 year old is probably blasting off.) The stereo is amazing (just like my TL) , I can blast my Beatles 2009 Remastered Box set on a USB stick and listen to every album ever made in the history of mankind (except The Beatles) on Spotify. The backup camera is awesome, I have a much bigger screen than the one on my iPhone for navi and I can even paddle shift if I want to. (I really don't want to so much.) The car is beautiful inside and out, rides and handles like a dream and gets 30 friggin' mpg! Okay, the voice recognition sucks but voice recognition always sucks. Maybe when I get Siri Eyes Free this week, that'll even be awesome. Anyway, this is the perfect car for me and I just don't get it."

It's nice to be able to enter your car and have your phone pandora station playing immediately. Plenty of standard ammenities. The back-up camera is great for parallel parking (you can even change the camera so that it is looking directly down at your bumper) Breaking is great. I was in an accident in the vehicle and couldn't have felt safer. For the severity of the accident (was hit on the front left of my bumper when I was going 20+ MPH; driver turned right in front of me on a two-way street) I was surprised at how little damage was done to the vehicle. Very well made vehicle. You can't go wrong with a vehicle that has the Honda/Acura name on it. Most reliable make on the market and not to mention they last forever"

It has been an great car to own. No issues, but a light bulb in two years. The features, interior and looks are great for a small car. Great on the road, but wish it had a bit more power for mountain passes etc even though the mileage is good. Did I mention comfort! The factory tires I replaced and it has made a huge difference on road noise. Its my first Acura, my friend drove it and she bought the 2.0 Tech model! She loves her's as well and her first too.

Fusion was way overpriced; Accords also too expensive. Civic was good, but for the same payment, we were able to get the Acura. Why not right? The ILX drove quieter and smoother than the Civic, with more luxury. The car feels very planted on the road, stable and sporty - in the sense that it accelerates competently and turns are accurate and sharp. Interior noise could be better, but it's a Honda product. They're known for bad interior noise issues. The body is great; it reminds me of a BMW - especially the rear and quarter panels. The interior is luxurious, but I don't necessarily like the interior dash design. It seems shrunken and elongated. It's just a preference, though. The sound system is really good and I appreciate the bluetooth audio. Also, why no dual exhaust pipes? Actually, you can't even see one exhaust pipe, which is really strange. I just love the look of dual exhaust pipes. Out Kia Sportage SX has dual pipes and it looks great! I do wish AWD were an option, since we live where it snows. Plus, it would make me feel safer. Gas mileage is averaging about 30 MPG, combined, which isn't bad. Overall, a great car!"

              "review_text": "My significant other purchased this car brand new in place of her 10 year old Corolla. She got the 2013 5-Speed 2.0L automatic model. From a first look this car has a small and sleek design. The car sits quite low to the ground even for a small sports sedan. Due to the car sitting as low as it does interior visibility comes at a premium. Blind spots can be somewhat difficult to see pending how far back the driver's seat is. The view from through the rear view windshield is also somewhat small relative to similar sized cars. The interior is very nicely done in this car however, with all the electronic features easy to use and understand. In terms of comfort I gave the car a 4/5. My biggest complaint would be that the door frame has minimal room to rest your left hand if that is how you drive, it sits a little too high. Overall the seats are very comfortable for very long or short drives and have yet to cause me any discomfort (Have driven up to 4.5 hours in one day). One thing I really love is how well the seats hug you through turns, especially when taking on/off ramps at higher speeds. I always feel like I am in full control of vehicle. The steering wheel is very light and thus quite touch sensitive. So not much rotation is required to move that car in either direction. The pedals, both break and gas are very touchy. I wouldn't call this a bad thing necessarily, it's probably made that way for safety reasons. A little bit of gas tends to give you a good jerk and the same with the break. One thing I have noticed is sometimes the car seems to be in the wrong gear, usually too low when speeding up. I'm assuming that's just how it's tuned. The rear space is comfortable for two medium sized adults, three would make a tight squeeze. The passenger seat is just as comfy as the drivers. Enough storage room for all your standard needs. The trunk size is quite adequate for a car that seems as small as it is. Also rear seats fold down to provide extra cargo room. Sometimes the vehicle seems underpowered in lower gears given its low curb weight but I guess that's too be expected with only a 150hp engine. Though once you get past that little sluggish stage the car definitely goes. You can easily go up to 80mph on highway and not realize, because it seems like you're doing 65. Overall Acura did a good job introducing this new model. The car gets very good gas mileage. In the first 3,000 miles it averaged around 30.50 mpg (65%HWY/35%CITY)"

I truly enjoy driving with a stick, it makes driving more interesting. So I was torn about this car because I also wanted the in-dash navigation.

I had a 2000 Infiniti G20T, 5-speed, and wanted the same luxury options and great gas mileage, but most of what is out there in a manual trans are gas burners like Mustangs and Camaros. So glad Acura made a car just for people like me! It has every option I wanted, even a rear view camera, EXCEPT for a garage door opener option. Also can't get navigation, but didn't care. This car drives like a dream, and I have gotten many compliments on the nice exterior styling. Glad I waited until they came out with this model, it was so worth it."

I personally do not mid that you have to put premium in the gas tank, but it could be an issue for people that live pay check to pay check.I wish Acura had something like UVO which my girlfriends new KIA Soul has and hers was $10,000 cheap than my car.They could have added a nice tablet in the dash and the paddle shift on steering wheel is in the way.The flaw drive placement makes the car feel cheap with wires showing."

Upon a month a going back and forth to get the pricing right, I drove 5 hours around trip to test drive the SUV. During that time there were countless email messages and calls. Trying not to waste my time, I asked a couple of times why was this car on their lot so long? Trying to pull out more information, I specifically asked are there any dents, dings of scratches. The original email was not returned with an answer. I asked again over email and phone and told \"no, the SVU is in great condition.\" So I decided to move forward. I had to re-arrange my work schedule and find someone to drive to Delaware, OH. Upon meeting with Christine, she tried to get me to sign paperwork without test driving. We said we want to look at the SUV first, she seemed nervous when we asked that. LIKE SHE WAS HIDING SOMETHING. The first thing I saw was scratches all over the side and chips on the hood. I told Christine, this is a deal breaker. She said it would buff out, but was down to the metal. After trying to say I was not interested, she called her detail guy to try to buff out. While waiting, I decided to leave and went to inform her, I was not interested. Christine, left the customer she was assisting, said it was done and ran out the door, pulled the SVU into the shade to hide the scratches from direct sunlight. All the dealer did was use touch up paint, that washed off, WHICH IS A POOR ATTEMPT TO COVER UP. After specifically saying, you said the SVU was in great condition and it's not, you lied to me, ALL I RECEIVED WAS A \"I APOLOGIZE\". She then tried to get me to buy another car. She seemed so desperate to make this sale. I POSTED THIS ORIGINAL STORY AND SPOKE WITH THE GENERAL MANAGER UPON THE BAD REVIEW. I LAID OUT THE FACTS OF MY EXPERIENCE AND WAS TOLD \"THAT'S MY OPINION\", SEVERAL TIMES. HE SEEMED SO ARROGANT. I TOLD HIM IT'S FACT AS I SITED WHO I SPOKE WITH AND HAD IT IN EMAIL. THE MANAGER JUST OFFERED A POOR APOLOGY. IT SEEMED HE DIDN'T EVEN CARE AND TOLD ME HOW SUCCESSFUL THEY ARE. HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE TIME OFF WORK THAT TWO PEOPLE HAD TO TAKE, THE GAS AND MILEAGE SPENT...THE TIME WASTED. IF THEY WOULD HAVE SAID, THERE ARE SOME ISSUES PEOPLE HAVE SEEN, THEY MAY NOT BE AN ISSUE FOR YOU AND SENT PICTURES....INSTEAD SAYING IT'S IN GREAT SHAPE. LASTLY, MY ORIGINAL POST WAS TAKEN DOWN IN AN ATTEMPT TO COVER THIS UP. NEVER, I WILL EVER BUY A VEHICLE FROM THIS DEALER. THEY ARE MORE CONCERNED WITH THE SALE THEN BEING TRUTHFUL."

The 38 and 39 mpg are easy to achieve. The car is very quiet and has a nice tight turning radius. No problems for the first 15,000 miles and we love it. Cant say anything bad about the navigation system except that it wont let me enter information while I'm moving. I guess this is for safety, my 2009 does allow entry while moving. I'm a big guy, I wasn't comfortable in a 3 series BMW, but this car has lots of room. Another item to mention is the transmission doesn't have gears, it seems to accelerate continuously without shifting, nice feel. We added leather interior and door sill lights not too much else. We do like it, in all ways. I recommend it, take it for a test drive."

The Acura sees a lot of around town use but we've also begun taking it on longer trips. Recently we drove it from CT to Miami and averaged 48mpg. I don't feel the car is underpowered as some reviewers say. The power delivery is smooth and strong once the car is broken in. As a reference, my daily drivers are a Hemi powered 2013 Challenger and Dodge Durango Rallye Package. This car doesn't make the strongest first impression and seems pricey but once you live with it, you'll come to appreciate its comfort and convenience as well as it's luxury. It handles nearly the same as my son's 2012 TSX and he often will take it if he needs to go on longer trips because it has the Tech package. The Technology Package is worth every penny. Great Navigation and the ELS system is fantastic. If you travel, the live radar weather is a nice feature. If you want a nice small luxury sedan that meets or exceeds the mpg rating, this may be your car. Great finish and attention to detail. Another plus is you do get great service from Acura. Some things that could be better: the passenger seat should be a power seat in this class and the seat heaters could be a bit warmer according to my wife. HIghly recommended."

The car is also fairly strong for a 4 cylinder car but i recommend getting a turbocharger or supercharger for some extra hp! There is a ton of aftermarket parts for this car and that's another reason that this car is a target for thieves so if you do own an acura integra you know what im talking about! Make sure you keep yours locked up in a garage at all times!! The gas mileage i get varies since i have mine with a built engine and have an added turbocharger to it so i get between 15-20mpg, a stock gsr should get in the low to mid 20mpg. Overall i highly recommend this car as it's very reliable and makes for a great car to modify also!"

It looked amazing and ran like it was brand new. As a big car enthusiast I had certainly heard of the car and loved it the minute I saw it. Its leather seats are very supportive and appealing to the eye, but not comfortable for long trips. The cup holders could be larger and better positioned but thats about it as far as complaints go. The gauges are large and easy to read, with a 6800rpm redline hinting to the cars performance focus. The clutch uptake is very easy to modulate and the shifter is predictable, although the length of the throws could be a little shorter. For me it was a very easy car to learn how to drive a manual in. From the factory the cars output is a very respectable 140hp, it also makes for a great starter power plant with a huge number of relatively affordable performance parts. This motor pulls very well considering its displacement and lack of VTEC(Variable valve timing). These cars are extremely fun to drive and the front wheel drive is more forgiving in many situations. The steering as with most Honda's/Acura's is a little light, linear, and communicative. Another Honda trademark is the B18's rev happy nature, putting out its peak output well above 4500rpm. The car is beyond reliable, only requiring typical maintenance. If you take car of these cars they will take car of you, running for 200,000+ miles. I almost for got to mention the gas mileage! Even during spirited driving this car is a fuel miser compared to other sports cars. Overall a great car can't think of much I would change about it A+"

Then added 50+ thousand trouble free miles and sold it for $6K. So value wise, owning a car for 3.5 years / 50K miles for $500 is a HUGE VALUE to me! By the way, all that needed replacement were the brakes, tires, oil and filters. Just the normal stuff that any car would need. I ran into the guy that I sold it too 5 years later. The odormeter had 285,000 miles logged on. And still going strong! The 1991 Interra LS was sold so that I could buy a brand new 2000 GSR. I have 78K on her. She has been completely trouble free. Did I mention that I race? My cars see redline almost every time I drive them. It is just so much fun to drive the Acura and Honda cars. They take it, then always ask for more! They never let me down,,,,,,,,,,,EVER! That goes for my circle track Honda Civic and roadcourse Honda CRX Si. I have won the track championship 2 times with my Honda Civic. OK- getting back to the 2000 GSR. It's handling is nimble. Then engine is powerful (170 HP.) The brakes work quite well (I brake very late and hard.) The transmission, oh the transmission,,,,it is as smooth as butter going through the gears! The ride is perfect- not too stiff like a racecar, but firm enough to have lots of fun through the turns without needing a chiropractor! The sound system has been just right- no problem and nothing aftermarket, it just works fine. I like the sound of the engine since installing a cold air intake and exhaust systems. I can drive this car like a little old lady, but she likes it to be tached up to 8,000 RPM also. So, if you plan on just having a fun to drive, excellent value, reliable, performance little car that also gets around 28-30 miles-per-gallon, don't look any further. This is the greatest car I've ever owned hands down. I have owned about 25 cars so far. It is also great in the snow! I don't even have all season tires, and it does OK in the snow. But I do highly recommend all seasons or even snow tires if you have to drive alot in that weather. (I do use my SUV 4x4 for the heavy snows.) Good luck and may Honda and Acura be number 1 in your book as it is in mine! Thanks for reading."

I love the coupe-like profile, and you can barely even tell it's an Acura/Honda from looking at it for 5 seconds without noticing badges, and that's why I like it a lot. Interior Design: I honestly don't know what to say. It's definitely way more simple than those xxxxty modern car interiors that look way too fancy for me. Value: I bought it for just $300, so that's a steal right there. Reliability: A few parts don't work, but I can easily get aftermarkets, so that's a good thing. 159,000 miles, and that little engine can definitely last another hundred thousand."

It gets great gas mileage and the styling is holding up well. Power everything, with leather interior, and a spoiler on the back keeps it sporty and the engine is plenty powerful enough for a car of this size. It still looks good when I leave work and see it sitting in the parking lot next to other cars. The tires wear well and I do not have to replace them as often as my other car.

Leather interior is not the greatest quality but that could be from lack of care by previous owner; not sure. With automatic transmission, car is slightly underpowered. Have to keep the \"revs up\" in order to get decent performance. I polish and wax car 3 - 4 times per year and paint is holding up well. Brakes are excellent but did use aftermarket pads and installed new rotors; much less brake dust now. Pads have 30K miles and are still at 75% or so. Handling is excellent; can't believe suspension hasn't softened since I've owned it; corners as if it's on rails. Hatchback is very useful for hauling stuff from hardware store: Had 800 lbs. of concrete in back from Home Depot! The trick to buying one of these \"used\" is to make sure it's not \"used up;\" that is driven by a teenager or younger driver. I found mine as a trade-in at the Acura dealer."

I'm a bit on the OCD side...lol. Was happy I was able to do all the maintenance myself. I spent about 3000.00 in parts (this is a hobby) and calculated that all the stuff I did would be prohibitively expensive if done at a shop. Even put a fresh coat of Red paint on the exterior, looks sharp. Estimated value now has increased about $4000.00 !! While not the fastest thing on the road it certainly is fun to drive."

Good gas mileage. A truly beautiful car. I wish I still owned it. The only down side is that trim level, the GS-R only came in four colors, none of them my favorite.

I have one design complaint: If the dash lights are anything above the minimum brightness you can see the reflection of the speedometer in the windshield, which I find very annoying. The one true black mark for Honda is the clutch. I have owned/driven a number of hondas in my life, and none had clutches as rough as the clutch for this car, and that includes the original and the OEM replacement.

When I bought an Infiniti G35S last year, a second-car discount on my insurance swayed me to keep this one instead of selling it. Over the past few years I've replaced the distributor cap, timing belt, and muffler, and fixed the clutch -- all things that fall under maintenance, so I can't complain. Now I have a great second car that helps keep the mileage off the Infiniti, or a loaner when a friend's car is in the shop. It was worth the repairs because at almost 180000 miles it's still a smooth ride. Given the longevity of Honda engines, I suspect I'll probably hold onto it a while longer. I only wouldn't recommend this outright because it's an old car, but if you need a basic, reliable ride for low $$$ you can't go wrong with this one."

I haven't had to sit in the back seats, but they look alright. And of course, it's an Acura, so it will just keep going. You can get 300,000 miles out of it no problem.

Milage is pretty good. I don't have the V-Tec version, but acceleration is still good in the city. I am usually the first off at the lights. On the Hwy it got up to 190km/h when I floored it.

But other than the clutch that I replaced two weeks after I bought it, the car was a tank and never let me down. The a/c never gave up. The interior was outdated but still in perfect shape for the age of the car, and the trunk was surprisingly roomy. If you're on a very tight budget and if you're looking for an old car, good on gas, cheap to maintain, and if you can find one that has not been modified, go for it, no matter what the mileage is."

And I love this car WAY more. This car works well for me because it is little, and I am not a very large person. At the same time, bigger and taller people can fit in this thing because of how the seats are angled. I've seen it happen in my own ride. It's not too bad on gas at all, but considering it's designed to be a sports car, it probably guzzles gas a bit more than say... a Honda Civic. But yeah, she's classy in front, and sexy from behind. A true JDM classic. She has a pretty dang spacious hatchback-trunk, as well. Another couple reasons to consider an old Integra, is parts for this car are cheap and plentiful, especially on eBay. You can basically have an old car that runs almost like a new one for dirt cheap if you take advantage of that. I got her pretty tuned, and let me tell you, she is friggin' fast. And gonna get faster. Believe me, I've got plans for this car, flippin' sweet plans. And I've got mostly eBay to thank for that. And local parts stores as well, can't forget them. Even though this car has been discontinued, it is certainly not obsolete, trust me. The other reason is you can probably find one on Craigslist or Facebook marketplace used, for dirt cheap. Which is what I did. Just sayin'. Anyways, thanks for reading this review, and I hope you buy a SICK 'teggy soon, but particularly, I hope you buy a Gen 2 Integra. Have a blessed day"

              "review_text": "Let me start by saying that the only reason I gave it four stars in comfort is because of how cramped the back seat is. For the driver and front passenger, it's VERY comfortable! I had the 1993 Acura Integra GS Coupe, with a 5 speed manual. In regular driving, gas mileage was about 30-32 mpg. But, since it was a manual, I found that I could always cruse in a higher gear that was \"necessary\" in order to get even better mileage. I usually got about 320 miles to a (13 gallon) tank, but being stingy about the gearing and the way I drove, I got up to 360 some times. It may have the styling and fun of a coupe, but it is technically a hatchback, and comes with all the versatility and practicality of one. You can lay the seats down flat and have huge cargo space, but even if you don't, the trunk is a very good size for such a small car. You also get a rear window wiper, which is one thing I can't stand not having. Being the GS trim, mine came with very nice black leather seats, a power sunroof (far better than most, I might add), power windows and mirrors, and antilock brakes. Even though the antilock brakes is only offered on the GS, they all come with four wheel disks, which is very good, considering it's a 90's car. Another thing to mention is that THIS CAR IS FAST! Not like \"European Supercar\" fast, but fast. It will do 110 miles per hour in fourth gear. Imagine what it can do in fifth! It goes from 0-60 in about 7.5-8 seconds. I've never actually timed it, that's just my guess. It also has a nice exhaust note. It would sound better with a magnaflow, but for a stock four cylinder motor, it sounds very good! I LOVED that car, and would have kept it for a good long time. Unfortunately, I was side-swiped by a big SUV, and the car was beyond totaled. It's totally crash worthy, though. It was a pretty nasty crash, and I walked away with only minor bruises. I wish the same could be said for the car, though. Definitely a car worth buying, you will not regret it! It only lets me pick one primary use, so I put Just getting around, which is what I did the most. But if you're looking for a car to have fun with, the Integra will not disappoint!"

In the 11 years I've owned it, I had to tow it only once (and that was because my mechanic had screwed something up that morning). Great gas mileage. Excellent visibility all around. Surprising amount of cargo space. Still looks sharp after 14 years. Parts are easily available. Outstanding car. Complaints: Not many. Back seats are cramped (it's a small car, after all). Peppy, but could use a few more hp. Overall, I'm very happy and would buy one again! Tip: Avoid Integras that are all pimped-out, sellers with stock Integras are less likely to have abused them."

It's been a fun little car - it's not a family size car and you can't move all your belongings in one trip - but it's amazing how much storage capacity it has as the back seat folds down. It's fast and sporty yet reliable. The only drawbacks to this car is that it is low to the ground, a very tall person would not like it.

              "review_text": "I got a 91 KA7 (Sedan) Acura Legend L as a point A to B car in college. Considering that it had over 400K known miles on the motor before the odometer clocked out along with the speedometer even issues with the transmission it was a shockingly pleasant car. The original owner(s) never took care of it but this car was a beast. It kept on moving regardless of issues. My main issue as a college student was never having the money to properly fix it up, my area lacked a lot of these cars so parts were hard to find in the junkyard. The times for some sad reason another Legend KA7 sedan or KA8 coupe ended up in the junk yard most times parts were easy to take and use on my car I was using at the time. As a student I managed to replace parts on this car rather easily with research and restored it to its former \"working glory\". Can't get around transmission issue really or fix the speedometer without destroying the transmission so I used a Speed App on my phone to get around. It isn't a bad fix to actually fix the transmission but as a college student I made due with what I had. Poured some Lucas in there and made it work. These cars are a rarity. Actually found out they are rarer than BMWs, but then again it depends on the city. My college town has very few riding the streets. I never really noticed any others out there. Tallahassee FL on the other hand I saw some there every time I went out there for family. Even their junk yards had plenty of them there due to poor treatment. Admittedly I received the car with some cosmetic issues but for it's age and appearance it was still a head turner for anyone I pulled up to. For their time they actually had a ton of features way ahead of their time in the 90s. Minus the fact that there are no cup holders this is definitely a car of Luxury, Reliability, Comfort, and even Power. 4 Speed Autos can be driven as a clutchless manual with the gears (1, 2, D3, and D4). With 200 hp, a wider body and lower ride for cars in this category this car will get up and go. So long as one is willing to understand the age of this vehicle if anyone is able to find one in great working condition or knows how to fix cars rather well I'd highly recommend this vehicle as a Luxury, Family, or even a fun car. I miss the car everyday and I dislike sedans. Looking to maybe one day get a 95 KA8 (coupe) Legend LS 6 speed manual with the type two C32A5 3.2L V6 230hp motor. Honda placed a lot of thought into making this car. Though it is still made overseas the name for Acura has been changed over to \"Acura TL\". The Acura/Honda Legend are amazing cars as a sedan or a coupe. As a automatic or a manual they are made to run for the longevity of the owner so long as they are taken care of."

Have also replaced both driveaxles, fuel pump, stereo,etc. The alarm sys malfunctioned 5 years ago. Good things include exhaust, brakes, interior condtion, xmission, power acc.

I didn't change the oil as frequently as needed and the engine gave out. This car is very expensive to maintain, if you don't have a lot of money its very hard to keep it up.

Too many things start to break (interior as well) and Acura has stopped making a lot of parts and is only set to get worse.

Car has remote start from app. The Cabin control app also allows the passengers to control their temperature, fan, even sunroof length."

I missed my MDX every day. It was so exciting to hear the 2022 model would be coming this spring. I have owned my mine for nearly a month and absolutely love it! It drives like a dream and is a beautiful car, inside and out. The adjustable seats in the middle row are a nice touch, as well as the removable middle seat. The third row is big enough for children, or smaller adults could easily ride back there for short distances. Personally, so far, I have not found the technology system difficult to use. It does take time to get familiar with it, but if you spend a few minutes playing around with it before you hit the road, it is pretty easy. It is time for Acura to be recognized as one of the best luxury vehicles on the market. I encourage anyone looking for a mid-size SUV to take a look at this one!"

The cabin is quite, comfortable, and pretty. The driving dynamic mode has 3 options: Comfort, Normal and Sport. The Sport mode is great - it tightens the steering wheel and really kicks up so the car doesn't feel so heavy (like when you can feel the engine working to drive such a heavy car). I could really go on and on about the MDX - but just go test drive it - you'll love it! And the new front exterior re-design (I believe it started with 2017) makes it look so intimidating and sexy!!!"

A relatively inexpensive owner's manual was also missing. And, we discovered it was missing the floor mats. All three items were standard for a new ACURA, per ACURA. We were reimbursed by the dealership for the fob, but not for the floor mats. The car is fine. If I were EVER to consider another used car from this dealership, I would ask for a complete, and I mean COMPLETE, list of everything that comes standard with a new car, and a list of every item that the used car in question does not have.

Blind spot detection/parking sensors are not standard in the base model, which for a \"luxury\" vehicle should come standard in my opinion instead of having to pay up to $6k more to get those features in a Tech package. Long review short, I traded in my basic 2019 MDX for a 2020 Kia Telluride EX and couldn't be happier. I wanted more from the Acura and thought even the base model would have a lot of great features but it didn't. If you like Acuras and like a lot of tech features, don't get the base unless you have the extra cash to get into a Tech or A-spec model, which are really nice."

I do NOT like keyless cars, but that is my preference and nothing to do with Acura. Specific to the MDX, the doors are light weight and tinny feeling. The lumbar in my seat rolls around while I drive, there is a grasshopper hum sound on my roof when I am on the freeway. This is a brand new car, I've had it for 3 months. My door sensor was replaced at 1 week. The car quality feels low end, the price tag is not. Outside of the manufacturing short comings, this vehicle is ALL buttons. Push a button to start the car, push a button to drive reverse and park, push a button to operate climate control, radio, and all car settings. It is very distracting if you are driving because you MUST look at the screen in order to navigate these features. I've found this to be a negative about the car as I would prefer a dial or physical something to push rather than a touch screen button."

Performance and styling are great and I haven't had anything needing repair so great initial quality (time will tell in regards to long term reliability). Android Auto/Apple Car Play, refined 9 speed and active dampers really make it a joy to drive. Any previous issues/complaints with the ZF9 speed transmission really appear to have been ironed out in my 2019. Only main gripe so far is the driver foot rest / dead pedal is a bit too close, too wide, and at too steep an angle for comfort. I'm 6' and it bothers me. More of a nuisance then a real problem but definitely wish I had an extra inch or 2 of legroom for my left leg. Another complaint (minor) is that the Adaptive Cruise Control works but is touchy. While it works well and brings the vehicle to a complete stop in stop and go traffic as advertised, acceleration can be somewhat aggressive/rough at times but overall it works great. Just wish it were a little less agressive with the throttle so it was more smooth. Compared with the Q7 and QX60 and glad I decided on the MDX. The Q7 would have been a great vehicle but ultimately I was concerned about long term reliability, cost of maintenance/parts, and the added cost in terms of purchase price and subscription fees to fully use the virtual cockpit/headsup display with navigation/route guidance. In terms of available features and value for the money it's really hard to beat the MDX."

I still give them an A, but there is a little work needed. 1: if you call the rep to find out where your warranty paperwork is, the rep should call back within 24 hours, im still waiting on a call back 3 weeks later. 2: transparency with the payoff of an old vehicle, I shouldnt have to pay late fees because the check was late going out, after I was told to stop paying. 3: the follow up is terrible, it takes 2 minutes to call a customer \"hey how is the car working out for you, do you have any questions, do you know of anyone looking for a new car I could take care of like I did for you 4: sales manager should be checking in with the customer (even as above) to check that the sales rep is being honest and that the customer is truly happy (this can save a bad sale and put the icing on the cake for a good one 5: Adrian is a great sales rep, with the right mentor you have a solid leadership trainee waiting to learn, develop the kid, before someone steals him. So this review should be from the day after thanksgiving, not today, I had spent most of my Thanksgiving looking at replacement vehicles (I just had 2 massive spinal surgeries in the last 12 months, one from 12/18/19 and one from 10/11/20, I had been an Acura owner over and over for 14 years, I bought 6 Acura's total, 2 TLX's and 4 MDX's, I love the cars, I switched in 2019 to Toyota, this place has earned my respect and my business. I have looked at the website so many times my eyes crossed, colors, specs, condition, cost, after market packages, and then the part that nobody wants to deal with......... The salesman........... normally id happily watch seal team 6 waterboard and torture the rep just to get a fair price, but Adrian just wanted a fair deal all around and to make a sale, I could have happily driven every car on the lot and he would have kept going, very polite/eager/ambitious young man. As a seasoned sales rep myself of 25 years I spotted the potential in Adrian very quickly, he uses the Sandler method in most cases, but he listens and if he doesn't know he doesn't try to BS hi way through it, he goes and gets a legit answer. As a heavily disabled veteran I was in a great deal of pain, he understood very quickly why I needed to switch out vehicles, and also. There were some service related issues, a couple repairs that needed done, those were fixed promptly, a couple of scratches that happened during the refinishing process (paint and interior protection) and a scuff on a couple of rims that were repaired also, they did an amazing job in doing. Chris in service is extremely customer oriented and knowledgeable, ill be adding Acura aftermarket parts as time goes on and will be referring people to their service team. Chris has a lot of responsibility but is happy to stop and answer a question or offer advice, and he\u2019s quick to return a phone call too. There\u2019s a couple of minor discrepancies between the certification checklist and the car itself that I need to get answers on. Most dealerships have a process they all follow, you meet with the sales rep (who normally has an IQ low enough to be a door greater at Wal-Mart), they fill out paperwork better known as a social profile about you (which they intend on selling to marketing company. This was done to me at McGrath, the salesman wanted me to fill out a form with all of my extensions and user names for Twitter/Facebook/Instagram and run a credit report (despite it being a transaction) before allowing me to test drive a car, when they realized I wasn\u2019t the average person/customer. Acura\u2019s are in essence luxury Hondas, three trim levels on each car to choose rom, Base/Technology and Advanced, the newer models 18+ you\u2019ll notice i significant difference in power compared to older models (partly to emissions laws, and also power to weight ratio and gear timing My first MDX I put 220000 miles on it, ZERO major repairs just routine maintenance and rust proofing (I recommend this on all Japanese cars due to the significant difference in how they treat their roads with chemicals to deal with snow. Getting older and having major medical issues I purchased the prepaid maintenance and got the certified pre-owned which extends the warranty out, while the warranties are not worth it to some, ive come to learn over time with inflation that the tie rod that. This is my 6th Acura, 4th MDX and I had 2 TLX\u2019s"

The ability of the second row to slide back and forth, thereby giving 3rd row passengers more room, is priceless and other car manufacturers should follow suit. Also, the ability of the second and third row to fold completely down allows for Home Depot and Lowe's runs for various products. I definitely recommend the MDX for families and for family trips."

Overall I like the car but probably wouldn't have paid the price looking back 6mo since i bought it."

              "review_text": "The current 2018 MDX is a very good and popular crossover. And in typical Acura form... they've managed to produce a vehicle that has versatility and value. One that has three rows for expanded carpooling, but is a bit smaller than many competitors; one that has a bevy of tech and safety features; and one that is incredibly smooth. For me, a single guy about to turn 30, I made the switch from the TLX sedan to this over 4,000-pound beast for a few reasons (none of which include needing room for 7 haha). But in making that switch, I knew things were going to feel different in terms of driving dynamics. And overall though, I can say it's been fairly seamless and that the MDX was a very familiar feel... highly typical when sticking with the same brand. And while on occasion it feels a tad big (like when parallel parking or weaving through the tight side-streets of a southern New England milltown), overall, I can easily say it drives smaller than it is... which is definitely a plus. Having a wider, more athletic stance its sister Honda Pilot helps it feel very planted in corners and not very top-heavy. The front seats are some of the most comfortable I've ever sat in (and as a car enthusiast, I've been in a lot of different cars). The Tech Package upgrades the sound system, which is absolutely fantastic and highly recommended for audiophiles like myself. Additionally, the Tech Package gives you Navigation, a slew of safety features, and remote start. And I can honestly say, even though it's only been in one snow storm so far, this car may as well be a plow. It's excellent! You actually work hard to get it out of shape, which tells me the traction control, SH-AWD, etc. are all doing their job. Unfortunately though, it's still lacking in some areas, the biggest being the power and drivetrain. I'm sorry Honda, but the ZF-9-speed transmission is garbage! After all the issues that Chrysler has had with it in their vehicles, I see Honda's implementation of it in their vehicles, in a luxury line no less, as an abysmal failure. It's wonky from a dead stop: if you baby it, you go no where... but if you give it any gas, it surges you forward like a rocket (but not in a good way). Believe me, I love a car that can get-up-and-go... but if ever I find a car I like has a ZF 9-Speed Automatic in it again, I'll cross it off my list and keep on looking... I don't care how much I like it. The V6 has a good, throaty sound (as throaty as you can get from a luxury crossover) and it provides decent but underwhelming power, something I attribute to the transmission too. Unlike the potent direct-injection 4-Cylinder I had in the TLX with the 8-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (a match made in heaven, IMO), the big single-overhead-cam V6 just doesn't deliver with the low-end torque, particularly at highway speeds. Yes, it's the \"corporate V6\", but it's aging... quickly! If I need to pass someone, I find I have to downshift at least two gears just to get going again. A larger turbo would probably be awesome in an MDX (like the 300+ HP 2.3L EcoBoost found in the Ford Mustang). Mate something like that with a better transmission (maybe the 7-speed dual-clutch found in the Sport Hybrid model?) and I think the results would be fantastic! Another part of the car I'm not thrilled with are the brakes. They are strong and quite smooth, but man, they creek incessantly. Every time I'm stopped, when I release the pedal to accelerate, I hear a creek from the brake caliber releasing. For a $50K luxury crossover this is unacceptable, and sadly, it's something Acura has had issues with in their SH-AWD vehicles going back to the 2012 TL! There is also (at least in my 2018) a squeal when hopping on and off the brakes, mostly when reversing (i.e.: when backing into a spot, etc.). I've had two dealers look at the problem... one couldn't figure it out so I received the \"it's normal for the car\" answer, and the other dealer thought they figured it out but I've heard it since. Not as often, but I've heard it. My concluding thoughts? For the money, the MDX is a really good buy and it IS a really good car. Would I lease another though? Well, it highly depends on what the alleged 2020 redesign brings to the table, because there is room for improvement. One can only hope the redesigned MDX gains more athleticism and power that mimics its smaller sibling, the RDX, while maintaining the smoothness and comfort MDX buyers love."

I have looked carefully and extensively at many other SUV's (including Audi, BMW, Ford, Infinity, Lexus, Lincoln, Toyota and Volvo) prior to getting each of the MDX'S and Acura continuously does a great job of providing a variety of amenities that the others either don't provide or not nearly to the same extent. These include spacious storage in the console area with easy access, an arm rest that slides forward/backward, a large hidden storage bin behind the 3rd seat and a compass with the street name currently being driven on, indicated at the top middle section of the gauge display (with GPS navigation information, while it;s being used, also provided in this area as well as on the center navigation screen). Also, the blind spot warning indicator is inside the vehicle near the front bottom corner of each of the front windows as opposed to where it is located in so many other vehicles where it is commonly within the side view mirrors which is not always easy to see when it's raining or there is ice or water on the mirror or even when the window needs to be defogged or defrosted. There many other features included in the MDX that are each well thought out by Acura. The MDX is very spacious and roomy and yet the vehicle has a relatively low profile when compared to so many of the other SUV's that are comparable in size. Bottom line: if you are looking for an SUV, make sure you take a good look at the Acura MDX. It is comfortable, dependable, enjoyable to drive, has excellent fit and finish, is loaded with features and is a great value."

The nine-speed transmission can be a bit much on takeoff, but shifts nicely, unlike others I've driven. This model has all the safety features, including the birds-eye camera, lacking on many competitors. The power folding mirrors come in handy in the garage and at the car wash. The dual screens require a bit of getting used to, but once mastered are a great feature, especially with the navigation at eye level. On top of all that, it's a good-looking vehicle, especially since Acura replaced that \"smiley-face\" grill (it was my primary reason for avoiding so much as test-driving one). This one's a keeper!"

The vehicle overall is made of thin metal, small stones would dent the front, top was dented by heavy rain storm. Paint job was poor and lacked finish, interior is low quality leather and plastic, very uncomfortable front seating for long distance drives, infotainment is poorly designed and not intuitive, GPS is horrible 1980's technology, steering wheel frequently failed to return to designation position (service department could not resolve), NO base from stereo system, adaptive cruise control does not work, false positives for collision control and applied brakes when not required. When driving the vehicle without trailer it is responsive, headlights are bright at night but automatic bright lights failed and had to be applied manually, lane control works well as long as it is not raining. Overall the vehicle was disappointing for the cost."

I was nervous at first because I didn\u2019t know what to expect and I thought it was going to be like other experiences elsewhere just being told and sold. But here at Radley that was not the case, I met a great group of sales person, managers, and financing. From the door out everything was simple and straight forward. What made this experience even BETTER was Mr. Jordan Jenkins (Finance Manager at Radley). Mr. Jenkins omgee was more than awesome if I could give him 10 stars I would. I mean he made the financing process so easy and smooth, he knows his stuff awesome job. He treated me like family as I seen his reaction with anyone he came in contact with. He\u2019s awesome!!! He even came in on his day off to complete my paperwork and to ensure that everything went accordingly. Now that's dedication and what a customer looks for to be treated like your cared about, I got that and more. He was very professional, friendly and all-around cool guy. The finance process was explained in detail was very clear and precise without being pushy and with no surprises. Everyone was friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and super helpful! Also, to mention Sean (manager), Karim (sales) was also great. Jordan, I thank you for all your help, providing outstanding service, going far above and beyond to make my car buying experience a happy one, I am most grateful. I mean I can go on and on because it was just that great. GO HERE TO BUY YOUR NEXT VEHICLE YOU WON\u2019T BE SORRY TRUST ME.

SYNC-2 earns it's name of STINK as the vehicle was a nightmare from day 1. I was able to take advantage of year end pricing to make the switch. The car has a very similar feel to the last generation BMW X5's I drove from 2003 up to the 2013. My 1st 2003 X5 had a V8 with ~290 HP, was fairly loaded up and cost in the mid $50K range. The 2017 MDX has ~290HP, cost in low to mid $50's depending on the options and seems to ride better. The MDX has the same thick steering wheel, steering wheel controls seat controls/angle it can be set to all have a familiar feel to them as they are similar to the X5. The phone interface seems a bit quirky (2018 has Applecar play) however most of these things just take time and a learning curve. The fuel economy is something I am already really impressed with. Getting in the low 20's in city driving and high 20's on the highway. The car rides extremely nice! It was the first thing I and several family members noticed when they have been in it for a drive. I purchased the vehicle based on the advice of 2 different doctors who can drive anything they want and they both said these cars are really worth a look and are a great value. About the only thing I am still not totally fond of yet is the front grill, an all mesh with smaller logo or something less garish would be the feedback. If the mileage, reliability and comfort remain at the high level I have had so far, then I don't think I will care what the grill looks like as my ownership experience goes on."

The 9 speed trans is a bit much, but I like that it holds a gear when driving down hill. I have found that it doesn?t downshift very fast if you want to pass a car in D mode. If I switch to S (sport) mode it works great. This car has a lot of technology in it and some of it is not intuitive. That just means I have to read the owners manual and learn how it works. I see a lot of people complain that this or that doesn?t work. In my experience as a master mechanic, I find that the owner simply has not learned how to use a feature, or it does not work like they think it should. I have had a problem with the voice activation feature. You can do almost anything from changing radio stations, putting in a address to changing the air temp. I just need to work with it some more. The one thing I do not like is the 20 inch wheels. It makes for a more rough ride. A 17 inch wheel with a non run flat tire has a much more comfortable ride and takes the bumps better. The active cruise takes some getting used to. This SUV is the only one I could find that you can turn off the radar and have a regular cruise control. I have only had it for a couple of weeks so I will update my review after I have driven in the snow and off road."

Dilemma time. Styling became deciding factor... couldn't overcome the ghastly front grill on the Lexus.

These features combined with a well-behaved 9-speed and the venerable and efficient V6 engine make for a drama-free ride. The 360-degree backup camera and parking sensors add a lot of confidence when backing in or out of a parking spot. These features are very helpful given the high hood and long wheelbase. On the downside, cargo capacity is small given the size of the vehicle. The high floor and low roof line limit the height of what can be placed in the back. There is a small enclosed area in the back floor but a large family should seek other more practical options. Overall it's a fantastic vehicle that provides a level of features and refinement that matches competitors' more expensive offerings. We're expecting it to serve as a reliable vehicle for many years."

I love the three driving mode options. Sport for some quick get up, Comfort for a road trip and Normal for commuting. The display is large and easy to use. Speaker sound quality is impeccable. Gas mileage is unbelievable for a car of its size, I average 22-24 miles per gallon with everyday driving and as high as 26 miles per gallon on road trips. There are numerous seat settings allowing you to practically customize the drivers seat and you can adjust the steering wheel. The cost of regular maintenance like oil changes and tire rotations in the Seattle area is reasonable. The only design \u201cflaw\u201d that I struggle with are the center cup holders. One is larger than the other so sometimes the drinks in the larger cup holder wobble more causing some spillage. Also, because it has more gears than usual sometimes the automatic shifting takes a minute to get into a comfortable gear mainly on hills. It takes a minute to get used to the multiple gears. I have no major complaints. Great car for a single person looking for a fun, stylish, luxurious and reliable car. Also great for a small family with plenty of second row room for car seats and third row space for booster seats or kids without seating assistance."

Our MDX has been amazing! The third row has been helpful when family and friends want to join us at events and ride with us. Packing and transporting bags for our family trips has been made easier since we can fold down the third row for more storage. The children love riding in the third row like it?s a new adventure! The MDX rides smooth and has been very reliable. I would definitely recommend this vehicle to family and friends?and I actually have!

The rear suspension makes noise at sags or bumps on the roadway, like a gremlin hitting the under body with a rubber mallet. Have taken the car in many times, replaced rear struts, still noise.

We loved our first MDX and owned it for 12 years and 180K miles, but we didn't jump on this 2016 MDX w/ tech and Entertainment because the styling seemed uninspiring both inside and out. Had to get entertainment/tech packages for 2nd row heated seats. Didn't want the DVD player or Lane assist stuff. The third row was cramped as well for two teenage kids. Surprisingly, all the full size SUVs didn't do much better in the third row either. Even the high end luxury brands. The GPS is clunky to operate. The voice activation doesn't really work. Even the sales person said Acura is working to improve it and showed me a faster, nonverbal way to work the bluetooth phone. I miss the days of simply pushing a real button to change heated seat settings or the radio station. The touch screen is distracting and visually cluttered. The UI on this has a long way to go. My $20K S. Korean made car has better tech and touch screen controls. Because of past experiences with Acura, I'm confident it'll run with few glitches. Simply change the oil, brake pads, tires and do scheduled maintenance. I worry the tech will fail before the mechanical stuff does. I view this car as a place holder until something better comes along. We like it. We just don't love it like our first MDX."

Paddle shifting this suv is an amazing experience & adds to the already sporty feel. Far better than the BMW X5, Lincoln MKX, Audi q5 & q7, etc. Traded my Lexus RX for a 2016 MDX & feel like the quality of my mdx is more comparable to what Lexus used to offer.

Super comfortable seats, excellent acceleration, sports car handling, not a single complaint about anything Fast forward to trading it in for the 2016 upon lease coming to an end, I do NOT like this vehicle one bit. Doesn't handle anywhere near how the 2012 handled. Tried all 3 suspension settings, and no dice. I'm not confident behind the wheel after 2 months Acceleration seems to have a \"turbo lag\" effect or the old 4-barrel V8 effect... step on the gas hard and it delays a good second or two until it takes off And many times I was already going 30 - 40mph and stepped on the gas hard, only to find the vehicle winding out in the current gear for a few seconds until it finally shifted into the next gear. I don't see why a vehicle like this has 9 gears Next, the seats. Total downgrade in quality of material from the 2012 MDX. And seats are lower to the ground, not giving an SUV feeling, but more of a regular car feeling. I've tried all kinds of seat adjustments and just can't find that comfort spot Next, the dashboard stuff is ridiculous. Heated seats is now a very distracting multi-step process via touch screen, as opposed to a convenient switch to the right of the seat for Low, Off, High. Ditto for controlling fan speed, A/C and heat, navigation, and so on and so on. In the day and age of distracted drivers, this thing is nothing but a big giant distraction Finally, the safety features are the most frustrating thing I ever experienced. I am CONSTANTLY being hit with distracting and annoying beeps and flashing warnings on the dashboard. When trying to pass someone, when backing out of a parking spot, and so on and so on. Not to mention the so-called blind spot enhancer on the drivers side mirror. It makes me dizzy everytime I look in the mirror and see 2 different views of what's behind me, one normal view and one magnifying glass view Bottom line... I would give ANYTHING to trade this thing in and step back to a 2012 MDX, and would not recommend the 2016 to anyone..."

I started it in the year 2000 with a 2001 Sport Coupe with the 6 cyl engine and kept it for 17 trouble free years, only repair being the transmission recall to change out the factory transmission. At the dealership suggestion I replaced motor mounts while the transmission recall was being exercised. Would have traded it in on this a new TSX but all they'd offer was $750 on the trade-in. I sold it myself for $3,000. I also owned a 2004 MDX that I'd bought used in 2008. It was my daily driver and I liked it a lot but after 6 years the transmission started to occasionally drop out of gear. So I traded that MDX in on a new 2013 TSX for my wife. She loves it. It's been trouble free for 3 years and I doubt if she'll ever let it go. It's the perfect size for smaller women. At that time I still had the 2001 coupe for my daily driver. I felt the loss without my MDX and suffered that loss for 3 years. Finally, I bought my current 2015 MDX, 2 years old and lightly used, and have had it now for 3 months. I'm dealing with a recent problem where the hatch seems to open on it's own accord. It's only recently has it done that. Last night my neighbor called saying my hatch was open. OK, I'm getting old and had not paid attention. That's the forth time in about a month it's done that and I hadn't opened the rear hatch for anything that day. I've swapped key fobs to see if the #1 Driver Fob was triggering the hatch inadvertently. I'm waiting to see if that's the solution. Otherwise, I'd have given my 2015 MDX as a five star award. I came to this web site to see if any other MDX owners were having the hatch problem."

The accessories make a nice addition to the appearance so we went with: running boards, fog lights, sports front grill.

However from the very beginning I had small electrical system nagging problems that dealership could never seem to rectify. It was overall realiable but because of electrical system glitches I never felt comfortable in using all of the features of the top of line model I had. The value of vehicle for the price paid I feel like was too expensive based on the very high cost of any service or repairs by the Acura dealership. When I was ready to purchase a new vehicle I test drove a new MDX but decided that the price did not warrant the features and past experience I had with my last MDX."

It gets 25-27mpg on the highway although it only gets 18-20 around town. The seats are comfortable and there's plenty of cargo room if you keep the third row seats down. The only thing it doesn't have that I would like is a heated steering wheel. My previous car, a 2012 GMC Denali XL, had a heated wheel, and in the winter it was really great to grab a warm steering wheel. This is a great family car and I would wholeheartedly recommend it."

Aside from a computer issue which caused the engine to surge at certain speeds, which was covered for free by a service bulletin (plus a free loaner), there have been ZERO ISSUES with this vehicle, plus with my FWD I'm getting 17 city and 32-33 highway. The interior is a bit plain, but the imitation wood is tasteful and not nearly as gaudy as in the previous generation. Plus, this is an SUV after all, not a plush luxury barge of the 1980's. My entire family switched to Toyota from GM during the late 1990's due to plummeting GM quality, however due to similar issues with Toyota, we have begun moving into Honda and Acura vehicles for the better comfort and higher quality. I love my 2014 Acura MDX, and for an SUV I consider it to be very good looking."

So far, my MDX has been very reliable as it nears 100,000 miles. The only downside has been a weird fluttering noise on the drivers side. It is low pitch but is really noticeable. This sound coincide when you drive at high speeds (highway driving) and I notice it from the window. If I open and close the window a time or two it may disappear for a while. I asked the technicians to check it and they did not notice it. It is annoying when I can't get rid of it for the ride. Plenty of power when needed.

MDX, Highlander, Explorer, QX60 and Pathfinder. We test drove the MDX first. It has a very confident driving trait, nice soft touch materials and technology package. The salesperson guided us in a winding backroads with moderate potholes. This car owned it. The downside is that the space is relatively smaller than the qx60 and brakes are mushy feel although still safe. We got an offer and then we went to infiniti. Qx60 is all about luxury. The only gripe about it is that the driving felt like i am on a pathfinder although 10k more expensive. Same platform, same transmissions and engine. But the size is awesome. There is fine jittery ride over the bumps although muted i noticed it. We also went to Ford. lots of bells and whistles on the explorer but when you drive it. Forget it, it feels like driving a truck. Without the ecoboost engine. their v6 is lame. We left and didn't like the Sales Manager either. Now highlander, We went there and we saw the sticker price for a highlander hybrid.($51k) My wife agreed about how cheap the interior felt and we left. Wife agreed. its Over priced. So in the end we end up with MDX. It's a beauty and classic. Then now here comes an issue. I am pretty sensitive with vibrations and sound on a car. When i had the car for 2 days, I didn't hear anything, it was Dead silent. However, this monday before i dropped of the car to install the accessories, i noticed a weird fluttering noise. It is low pitch but is really noticeable. This sound coincide when you only push the gas pedal. I asked the tech and he noticed it. He then said \"its the fuel pump, its all normal\" that i was just entuned to it and it will fade away as i get used to it. Sadly i haven't still. I cannot enjoy my quiet ride without turning off the music co'z i can hear it. i sent an email to Acura relations and will post their response. For a car that is at 50k, I expect a very quiet cabin. The road noise is muted but that fluttering noise exist. It might not bother a lot of owners. Sure has bothered me. I have read of owners having problems with the Variable Management , Heared no problem like that on my car. Shifting is Smooth, Plenty of power when needed. Gas Mileage still not to par. Thinking due to Very low temp. Overall, It is byfar the Best SUV in the market at its Category"

This is week two of ownership, and it feels somewhat more familiar. It will take weeks more to know the cabin well. Not sure I will ever like the voice guidance. It often doesn't get it! Liked my 2005 GPS as I could have my wife adjust,change where we are going while car was in motion. The new GPS seems to not want to work unless I'm totally stopped. Big Brother has intervened too much here. I like the blind spot indicator that allows you to note a car in your dead zone. The lane indicator beeps at you if you cross a traffic line above 45 mph without the turn indicator on. Can be a tiny bit bothersome and a bit strict.Yet it is doing it's job and reporting on me to me. Again, slightly Big Brotherly. Overall, a swell car, drives like a fine luxury car, not an SUV. Is as quick as can be (I purchased the front wheel drive model as I live in Calif) and a pleasure to drive (I do long distance driving, and this car is perfect for that). Improvements? Acura Roadside Assistance is not nearly as quick as AAA. Proved that twice. Acura wait time: one hour. AAA wait time 20 minutes. Overall Recommendation? Buy it. My 2005 Acura MDX currently has 190,000 miles on it, with absolutely nothing wrong with it. Nothing! A fantastic auto,and my reason for buying a 2014 Acura MDX again!"

At this price range, there are many options and I would not choose an Acura. The vehicle is cheaply made and in my opinion, Acura has not worked out their glitches in their new design."

I've owned a Lexus RX & BMW X3 and I'll go w/ the MDX all day long. The negatives would be the gas mileage (maybe 16-17 mpg city) & the initial acceleration from a dead stop, but my racing days are over, & it doesn't have a heated steering wheel. The safety tests are great, it handles like a champ in the snow w/ AWD, it has ample storage room (when the 3rd row seats are down), & the back seats are comfy. If you maintain it as you should, you shouldn't have any issues. Again, I've never had mechanical issues & I drive no less than 20K miles per year."

Look for yourself how forward the headrest are , terrible design! #2 - the radio is very static , I can not keep a radio station on while moving due to the static. The antenna is in the windshield and there are many reviews I read after I bought it that other people are having the same issues. #3- the 2nd and 3rd row seats do not move so you can not adjust the foot room. The Honda pilot I had before did have seats that moved so the kids could adjust it to their needs. #4- the gas mileage is terrible I do not like this car at all, its the most expensive car I have ever bought and I feel ripped off."

FIRST OF ALL, THE 2013 IS THE LAST OF THE 2ND GENERATION MDX WHICH STARTED IN 2007 & HAS PROVEN ITSELF OVER THE YEARS. I BELIEVE THE ALL NEW 2014 MDX HAS HAD A COUPLE OF RECALLS ALREADY. STYLING WISE, THE 2013 HAS A MORE AGGRESSIVE LOOK WITH IT'S MASSIVE DUAL CHROMED TIP EXHAUST PIPES, FOG LIGHTS, FLARED FENDERS, MUD FLAPS & A WIDER WIDTH. THIS IS ALL MISSING ON THE REDESIGNED, SLEEKER 2014 MODEL. THE 2013 ALSO HAS MORE HP, A GREATER TOWING CAPACITY, THANKS TO A TRANS/OIL COOLER & WEIGHS HUNDREDS OF POUNDS MORE. THE GAS MILEAGE IS REDUCED SOMEWHAT BUT THE EXTRA WEIGHT MUST PROVIDE A BETTER RIDE & GREATER SAFETY. ALL CONSIDERED, I AM VERY PLEASED WITH MY 2013 MDX & I SAVED THOUSANDS TOO."

They have gone from what was clearly one of the best systems to operate (NAV, Controls, bluetooth etc) to a system that is pretty much impossible. Voice prompts are very difficult in a system that now forces you to use voice prompts for almost everything. My last MDX allowed me to do pretty much anything on the fly and this one is now one of those cars where the designers have determined that we are not smart enough as MDX drivers to determine what we should and not use when we are driving. Just try to set an address while you are on the go. A good percentage of the time, my NAV doesn't even boot up and I have to wait for a stoplight to shut off my car and start it up again (this always resolves the problem). Sometimes the bluetooth won't connect with my phone so I have to do the same thing. Oh yes, I have a iPhone 5 and unfortunately, the designers of this car didn't think this was a popular enough product to have it work with the voice activation dialling so there is no connection so you can use your phone. Yes, you can dump the contacts into the system's address book but because the voice prompts are impossible to use, don't even think of using the contact list unless you are stopped at a light. Had it back to the dealer to see if they could fix some of this and they did a 'reset' of the system. Made no difference to these problems. You have 5 'speed dial' numbers you can use. After that, you have to use voice prompts to get to the rest of your speed dials and once again, 'good luck' getting the voice prompts to work. I use to love the NAV system and how I could 'search' ahead to look at alternative routes using the toggle (joystick). Now, the system is so crazy that it when you toggle you move around the map so far that you can't pinpoint anything. Easy button controls on all of my past 4 MDX's have been easy to use. Now replaced by a touch screen that is cumbersome, slow and unnecessary. If this was the only shortfall, I could get use to it. The system is also VERY SLOW. Slow to enter addresses, slow to start up, slow to react when you go through the screens or try to enter an address. Car handles pretty well. Not as aggressive as previous versions but still pretty decent. BE VERY CAREFUL. THIS CAR WILL DRIVE YOU NUTS if you are use to the 'easy to use' electronics of previous versions of this car. My wife drives a Mercedes GLK. I use to hate the NAV system on that car. Now I think the MDX designers have found a way to make it tougher. Sad that they have taken a fantastic car and really destroyed it. I had a 'loaner' 2013 TL from my dealer a few weeks ago. It was very frustrating to remember how easy the system use to be prior to the 2014 model."

This is the best midsize luxury suv I have ever driven. It has a smooth ride and a powerful 300 hp engine and it is very spacious. Although the the third row seats might not be as adult friendly as my mountaineer it is perfect for the kids. Gas mileage is great for a midsize suv and it's great being that gas prices are up and down I won't need to worry about spending to much. I also love the features such as XM. radio, rear back up camera, DVD entertainment, navigation system and much more. And I got all of this for just a little under 50 grand. If you are looking for a great truck that is full of luxury and can take you places in style then take a look at the Mdx."

I've carried 6 passengers very comfortably and my kids (13 & 18) are pleased w/ the rear seats and leg room . For me it far surpassed all competition in its price range (Jeep, GMC Acadia, etc). I prefer the previous models' body style, but this one is handsome enough for me. My only complaints (minor) are 1) the features and integration of the Tech Package (Navigation, Audio, Blue Tooth, Voice Commands, Reverse camera, etc) are truly incredible, but its fairly complicated to learn all the commands and how to switch back and forth (and I'm very tech savvy) 2) I thought the car came with remote ignition (which I really miss) and a roof rack (which I also miss). I probably should've been more vigilant prepurchase, but I also wish the salespeople had made this clearer. I'm looking at an additional 1.5K to add these features which were standard on many of the other cars I shopped."

Lots of techie type buttons that I'm gradually learning, but I'm sure in a few more weeks I'll have everything nailed down. As far as \"dislikes\" not too sure I'm going to enjoy having to put premium gasoline in the tank over the long haul, but it is what it is...wish they had a couple more cup holders in the front...and the third row seating doesn't have a lot of room. Short trips or with children no problem. Long trips would be another story. The Acura people from the salesperson, sales manager, service personnel have all been wonderful.

Had high expectations for the car until the first 2000 miles passed. - THEN the Check Oil at dealer warning came on. Very long story short. Thought at first the prior owner had not serviced the oil and engine properly - but NO - the engine is well-known by owners and Acura to have a defect in the ring/cylinder design that causes a VERY high oil consumption. Like a quart every 1000 miles. Acura issued a Technical Service Bulletin in July 2016 about dealers providing \"goodwill consideration\" in trying to appease irate owners. Long story short: They changed the engine design to have a certain aluminum coating in the cylinders - and the rings wear out from abrasion with the finished cylinder. There are attempts at getting a class-action lawsuit by a legal firm - and not sure where that will end up - but I've already registered with the law firm. The J37A engine is the consistent problem - in other Acura models as well. Solution: trade the car or replace the engine. Not a pretty picture. So I am trading ASAP. Heavier oil than the recommended 5W-20 could cause far greater issues in the engine. Statistics are showing that over 11% of the J37A engines have SEVERE oil consumption issues - rumor has it that rings were installed incorrectly at the factory. My 2007 MDX had a different version of the engine and never used oil. They changed to the J37A in 2008 and continued with it through at least 2014. I have no idea how reviewers have missed this - especially Consumer Reports. Acura is claiming it is normal to add a quart of oil at 1000 miles. Right...!"

The grille is another story, but after looking at it a couple of times you get used to it. It seems they could not come up with anything else distinctive."

New VW/Audi diesel significantly better at motivating this much tonnage, efficiency about a third better. Voice technology terrible, useless, must learn the Acura language. Blue tooth phone link also useless since sound is so bad can't have a conversation. Rattles, luxury Japanese autos should not. Lots of rattles some almost seem to be intentionally designed into the vehicle like the rattle that comes from the passenger seat belt receptacle or the one that comes from the top of where the 2nd row seat splits. AC and fan direction hidden when you turn on HVAC. Why? This is a distraction. Buttons are very hard to navigate like they want to force you to use the horrible voice activation system. Distraction. No interest in the car choosing the fan speed for me when I want to defrost the front windshield, sometimes I just need a little air flow, not gale force winds. Can't shut the 2 middle vents in front. Really? Fake wood is bearable but positioned so you get blinded by sun's reflection for prolonged periods when driving NE or making left turns. They can't figure out a rain sensing windshield wiper system? In California you must have your headlights on when your windshield wipers are in use. They can't program the \"auto\" switch on the headlight control to make the headlights turn on when the windshield wipers are in use. No, that would be intelligent, even luxurious. No power folding mirrors? Really? Interior is pretty nice and comfortable other than horrible control layout. It's been known for decades that knobs are better than buttons at things like changing temperature and fan speed. With a knob I could just go from zero fan speed to 1, or 2, etc., without having to verify on the tiny screen (no ON/OFF button required). Same with temperature, could just twist a knob if I'm too warm or cold not have too look over and down taking my eyes off the road. Why not show changes on the NAV/infotainment screen? Transmission wants to up-shift as early as possible to save gas I guess. This makes the downshift paddle necessary but the up-shift paddle unused. Tranny could probably use a few more gears but it is smooth except when you roll a stop and it clunks down when you hit the gas. Sport mode is pretty good. If the car didn't drive better than 95% of all other SUV's with 3 rows of seats I would call it a total loss."

It does not scream high-end like the price tag suggest. It is much easier to find better looking cars in the same price range, and class. (ex. Porsche Cayenne, Range Rover, Audi Q7, Lexus RX, and the BMW X5.) The interior design is just as bland, the leather and materials are nice and luxurious, but the technology is abysmal. To even get a screen in the car you have to get a technology package. However, there is a back-up camera that is conveniently hidden in the rear view mirror. The car comes with a big 3.7L V6 that is very punchy and decently responsive. But beware, this car gets horrible gas mileage (averaging around 17mpg with normal driving). One thing I absolutely hate about this car is the terrible transmission. It always seems to be in too high a gear and is extremely slow to respond. It is not even worth using the paddle shifters, because they either take too long to respond or just don't except your shift. However, the reliability has been very good, driving 50k miles the only major repair (besides oil changes) has been the timing belt that went out at 90k and cost 900 dollars."

We let him know that before we sit down to go over prices we need to see and test drive the car... So he proceeds to his manager to get the key to the car...... Few minutes after her comes back to let us know that the car is not iN the lot that the owner of the dealership is driving the car for personal use getting lunch.... A bit weird we thought but we waited for the car.. So the car finally arrives 30 minutes later we notice Victoria secret bags, nordstromsm bags, nail clipper inside the cup holder and nail clippings .... I'm not joking the car was dirty and smelly and it had a weird noise coming from the hood .... By the way they don't service the car unless if you commit to buy which we found this very odd.... Most dealers service their cars before they put it on the lot.... But I could be wrong .... We quickly decide that this car was not for us... We explain this to salesman but hen became very persistent and annoyed with us because we decided that we were done .... He then approach me as we were leaving in a very unprofessional and rude manor and scream at me because we were leaving he say something about him getting in trouble with his manager because of our departure .... I basically told him enough we don't need your business and we are done here..... After three hours my husband gets a call from the salesman asking him why did we leave the dealership .. My husband hang up the phone we were at that point done with the situation and moved to another dealer .... Not happy with service that was provided by the salesman and dealership."

Wife saw this used certified 2011 MDX, I balked at her idea. \"Really? Me in a non-American car? Don't think so,\" I thought. But I had to humor her like a good hubby and went to look at it for a test drive. Dang! Not only did it have all the features I was looking for (leather seats, dual climate control, Bluetooth connection for the phone) it had some extras I wasn't really looking for (sun roof, heated seats, backup camera, 3rd row seating)! But, I figured \"It's an SUV, it'll be slow as molasses. That is until the dealer told me, \"Go ahead, put it into sports mode and open it up.\" I did and was surprised at the zippy pick up it has! On top of that being certified it still had part of the original warranty and an extra year/12000 miles added to it! Logically, as much as I reeeeeeeeealllllllyyyyy wanted an American car, for the value of the MDX I couldn't turn it down (would have been crazy to do so!). So here I am, a staunch all American car gung-ho driver in a Japanese luxury suv enjoying every bit of it. Side note: My 2010 Impala is still kicking, gave it to my brother as a gift since his only car (a VW) was totaled and he and his wife have 2 kids."

This car promises to be even more satisfactory in terms of ride and being quiet. Other factors such as the compact 7 seat capacity are comparable to the 2005. Another reviewer really summed up my primary complaint and that focuses on the instrument panel. The speedometer is difficulty to read because the steering wheel blocks my vision at the position that is comfortable for me to drive. The fuel gauge is virtually out of sight and hidden in the recesses of the circular forms that are part of the panel design. I much prefer the trip information on the 2005; and as the other reviewer noted I am not much interested in the most accessible options. I want to know what my gas mileage is instantly and over a period of miles. That is not easily accessed as it is with the 2005. My only other concern is a general lack of response when accelerating compared to my little TSX."

Balancing has NOT fixed the problem. I would have expected better from a car in this price range. To be fair - city travel is very comfortable and all who ride in second row report a great ride.

              "review_text": "Needed a sooner than expected replacement after my 2005 X5 3.0 got totalled in an accident. After looking at 2012 X5, 2011 Q7 and MDX I ended up purchasing an MDX and my findings are based on two months of usage. Performance: In terms of performance I did not feel a lot different than the X5 (I had low expectations going into the MDX), of course the steering feel is no where close to the X5 and it took a while to get used when making turns and parking. Brakes felt good and there was enough engine power when needed and you can actually feel the SH-AWD working when the torque moves to the external wheel during curves/turns. There is a little wind noise at higher speeds but it not too bad and seemed normal and with the sound system you do not feel it much. Driving in all the rain we got in Chicago past few weeks was never a problem and the MDX handled exceptionally except for the lack of rain sensing wipers. Technology Package: If you have longer commutes or a music buff, opt for the technology package and you will not be disappointed. The sound output is amazing and I did not have trouble connecting my iPhone on Bluetooth and connecting an older iPod using the USB/AUX. There are a few minor issues like it would not store mp3 cds on the built in hard disk. Only audio CDs get ripped on to the hard disk. The backup camera is pretty useful. The voice recognition for music search and navigation works good though I cannot say the same about the navigation software. Having got used to google, I found searching for locations difficult since it does not sort by distance (maybe there is an option and I have not explored it) and I end up searching on my iPhone and then inputting the address. Interior: Needed a 7 seat option because of pressure from the wife and kids. Kids like the third row but there are no ac vents in the third row. Getting in is a challenge for adults like all three row SUVs and my daughter likes to climb in through the trunk and use one seat in the third row. The driver and passenger seats are extremely comfortable and the leather feels nice but seats could be more supportive. The second row middle seat for anyone more than average height would be inconvenient for the passenger because he would be seeing directly into the rear view mirror and the blacked out portion of the windshield. Its also inconvenient for the driver because the entire view would be blocked. The room between the rear headrests and ceiling seems less than normal and it took a while to get used to the rear visibility which was a little annoying. The gauges are a little crowded and I could never see the full fuel gauge in whatever position I adjust the seat or the steering. The wiper stalk was always coming in the way. Probably Acura would make them cleaner in the next version. The reviews said too many buttons but I got used to them. Like for example in the X5 reducing the fan speed all the way would switch it off and they just have two buttons, but in the MDX there is a button for on and off for the fan apart from the two buttons for increasing and decreasing the fan speed. Its more of user experience thing and nothing more. Hope you go the point. Exterior: I am hoping someone at Acura design got fired for all the beak grills they have. I just wish they hired better designers maybe they were trying to cut down costs and had the Honda designer multi tasking. The front grill is difficult to get used however I look at it. Maybe the 2009 grill was better. Other than that it looks sleek and does not feel like a 7 seater. I got the black roof rails and rack just to make it look like an SUV. I wrote more about the things that I did not like so people can make informed decision if that is something they care for. It does not mean I did not like the car. MDX is one of the best luxury damily SUVs and all I can say is for the money it is the best 7 seat SUV that you can get. Similarly equipped X5s (I could not find many 7 seaters even though I wanted to buy an X5) and Q7s were atleast 10k more and of course you get more prestige with them. I saved the 10k and will see how long I can resist to stay away from a BMW."

We both like the looks of the car, it has very nice fit and finish, the seats are very good, all the buttons are where you expect them to be . We did choose the base model, as we tried the Tech package, but neither one of us liked the Nav system much, the navigation stick felt a little clumsy, and the screen wasn't as clear as i'd like. We did a lot of research and found the Acura to be a very good value and it had certain things that where important to us, such as the gear shifter going straight back and forth instead of having all the \"gates\" I never really understood the point of that. It has regular side windows, instead of the small extra one you find on the Lexus RX, it just seems wrong, and reduces visibilty. The interior is very functional with cup holders and storage compartments in sensible places. So far we have not had any issues with it, and hopefully that will continue.

I traded in my '08 RDX and saw a big difference in quality, comfort and feel. The technology in the MDX is not too overwhelming, but very thoughtfully included. I really had a hard time in justifying purchasing an Audi Q5 as the quality of service and reliability of Audi has always been in question. This is true for both their vehicles and their dealerships. When one is paying around $50,000 for a vehicle, there should be no question of reliability or that the company will stand behind their product. In addition to the fact that the Audi Q5 is a small SUV that is around same price as the MDX being a standard size SUV. With Audi's reliability issues, you would think that they would price their vehicles appropriately. Acura does stand behind their vehicles and because of the level of service, quality of cars and their commitment to their customers I will not hesitate to buy Acura's in the future!"

Also, recently have gotten the \"Low Oil level\" indicator light flash on and off.. even though oil level is fine. Haven't fixed it yet... but research shows that it's a bad oil pressure switch. Love the car nonetheless. Easy for DIY mtnc - Oil changes, trans fluid changes, differential fluid changes, air filters etc. Easy for DIY and you can save some $ that way.

I have checked \"5 stars\" for reliability because this site requires an answer; we have only had this car a few months, but records show zero problems with the car per dealership that owned this car previously. Our last purchase was a Toyota Camry, which was a dependable and reliable road car; but it was just not as comfortable as the Avalon. With the increased back seat space and slightly larger overall interior space, more comfortable seats, and the legendary Avalon headroom, I can drive comfortably all day, in style, even though I am 6'3\" and have established myself generously beyond the 200 lb. mark. The front wheel drive, 3.5 liter V-6 with its 6 forward speed automatic transmission combine to give this car a quick boost when passing uphill; in fact, a step on the accelerator pushes you back in your seat like a race car. Our road mileage is about 28 mpg, despite the fact that this sold to us by a dealer who used it as a loaner car. Our particular car is loaded to the hilt with accessories, including Elaine the Electric lady (a GPS based talking trip adviser), who has made our travels to unknown (or forgotten) destinations a real joy. We are very pleased with the vehicle and outstanding price, as advertised on Cars.com. The 131 mile trip to an out of town dealer was well worth it; we would have traveled twice that distance for this car at the price we paid. It has become our favorite family car of all time (married 38 years); beautiful, powerful, comfortable, sleek and (so far) totally reliable; the hallmark of this carmaker's products. In fact, after researching the various cars through Consumer Reports and elsewhere for the last 3 years, we found the best car at any price. This car and model are a true winner in all respects."

I even found myself making up excuses to drive to the store or go get coffee so that I could take it for a spin :). I looked at the Audi Q5 in addition to the MDX in my car search. I was surprised to find that the MDX drove smoother and had even more pick-up speed! I traded in my '08 RDX and saw a big difference in quality, comfort and feel. The technology in the MDX is not too overwhelming, but very thoughtfully included. I really had a hard time in justifying purchasing an Audi Q5 as the quality of service and reliability of Audi has always been in question. This is true for both their vehicles and their dealerships. When one is paying around $50,000 for a vehicle, there should be no question of reliability or that the company will stand behind their product. In addition to the fact that the Audi Q5 is a small SUV that is around same price as the MDX being a standard size SUV. With Audi's reliability issues, you would think that they would price their vehicles appropriately. Acura does stand behind their vehicles and because of the level of service, quality of cars and their commitment to their customers I will not hesitate to buy Acuras in the future! Acura has consistently been one of the top car companies in reliability, quality and overall value. The MDX will not disappoint you!"

This SUV is so much fun to drive, in a world full of bland vehicles. AWD and exceptional braking make it ultra safe. Unless you really need the nav and MP3 features, the base model is a very good choice. You can hardly call a vehicle that has a rear camera, power tail-lift, power/heated leather seats, voice controlled Bluetooth, CD changer, moon roof and much more a base model! Front seats are superb. Middle row (reclines) is excellent. Third row is for kids or small adults only. I also personally like the styling very much. One thing I really like is that although this is a big vehicle, it does not feel or look like a van. Some SUV's are beginning to look like vans. I thoroughly recommend this vehicle."

It was ALMOST PERFECT, except for a few things Acura could have done better on. First, the price is almost as expensive as the TL. It's got to be at a cheaper price point to the TL with the same engine. Then the Navigation system. The NAV in the TSX is pathetic and small and dim compared to the beautiful one in the TL. They should make the NAV's the same. And lastly, Acura needs to come out with a V6 TSX Type-S. Something just a little bit sportier than the bland, pure vanilla, V6 they offer now. In summary, it is a really good car now with the V6, but with just a few more changes, it can become GREAT!! Hope this helps."

No vehicle I've ever owned handles better than a BMW but the MDX has more and better bells and whistles and doesn't give much ground in handling, especially considering the larger size. I believe the MDX just might provide the best value of all SUV's or crossovers. Our base model is well worth the price. The interior is quite plush and very comfortable and the technology is unsurpassed. It handles like a much smaller vehicle and provides the comfort and convenience of a much more expensive one. I don't know what else I could ask for. The only thing I miss from the X3 is the heated steering wheel. The lease deals on the MDX are MUCH better than the X3 as well. If you're in the market for a high-end SUV don't buy until you've tried this one. It's all you could want for less."

In all cases of the difference between the two packages, I don't care except for the backup feature.

I noticed that there is a drag/delay with MDX that is quite frustrating when you try to accelerate from a signal, stop sign or change lanes. Acura added a lot of control buttons that will confuse almost every one. It will take you a while to see external temperature, reset your trip meter etc. Even the radio does not display station names or song titles. (My 2004 minivan does!). The Navigation system is not very friendly either. My $150 Garmin will display speed limits and street view, where as Acura's do not. There are other irritations too. If you open the sun-glass holder, the glass will fall right down because of the door position (very silly).

Noise levels are very low- the new MDX seemed quiet to me on every road surface I've ever driven it on.

The Navigation system is easy to use and especially to use and comes in very handy because it comes with a back-up camera. I feel the Sport version's rim complement the body style best.

Originally upgraded my wife to this to haul the babies around, but she thinks it is so pretty and pristine that she's relegated them to her old (my new hand-me-down) MDX.

The sound system, navigation system and HFL are also extraordinary. Would buy this car again in a heartbeat and would recommend this vehicle to anyone who loves driving and wants an awesome (did I use this word yet?) experience!"

              "review_text": "Bought a 2008 MDX Tech/Entertainment package after an 2003 Audi A6 with many problems. Acura is a great car with more positives than negatives about it. Very quiet including road noise for a Honda product(I also own Toyota's) and loads of fun to drive. The technology in this car is fantastic. The ELS sound system is awesome but good luck finding DVD-Audio discs to bring it to the full potential!! Bluetooth works great, Nav system is very cool. There are alot of buttons in this car but very easy to navigate around. The engine is a little lagging on the low end torque but the more I drive it the more power it seems to get. Handles great with no body roll at all. Our 6 person family fits in it quite well, looks small on the outside but very big inside. I only have 2 complaints with the car. The rear suspension is noisy when going over bumps, kind of a thunking noise that I didnt notice on the test drives. Once you spend time in it you will know what I'm talking about, big flaw for a luxury vehicle! The other is a poor designed steering wheel, from the shape, the lack of tilting/telescoping enough leads to uncomfortable hand/arm placements for long road trips. I'm 6ft tall and the wheel doesnt drop low enough and come close enough. You end up raising the seat height to accomodate after awhile, bad design indeed and my wife agrees. Oh yeah, one other thing, don't put anything that can melt in the center console, it cooks in there. Overall great car but it should be for the big price tag! Tried other cars in this class but there was really no comparison. Ive always good luck with my Honda's in the past so I'm hoping Acura is even better."

I feel lucky having taken that test drive , I ended up in getting the 2008 MDX with sport/techn/ rear DVD , my only take on Acura is that the parking sensors are not standard ..but even after spending $600 on these sensors , Its an excellen deal . even compared with other SUVs in the $$75,000 range ..."

It is the best value for money and comes with sufficient label prestige to boot. When I signed on the dotted line for the Acura, I felt I was giving up some prestige going from the Bimmer to the Acura, but that lasted only till I left the dealership and drove home. The first ride made me forget my buyers remorse and I was all excited to show of my new toy. The ELS surround sound is the best I have heard in a car! I consider myself an audiophile and have a 3 dedicated 7.1 systems (Canton, Klipsch and Sunfire systems) in my house complete with a home theater but when it comes to car audio this one takes the cake! If you are thinking about an SUV this should be on your list to test drive."

Right before the end of 2014 I had the opportunity to buy a 2007 model but it had 140,000 miles and a couple of minor problems. I went with my gut thinking that I would drive it a year or two and then trade it for something else. It's now March 2020 and I still own this vehicle. 140,000 miles have turned into 255,000 with no end in sight. Yes, there are regular maintenance concerns and I have probably pumped $7,000 into it over time but the original deal still makes this a tremendous value. Regular maintenance and careful driving will make sure these cars last well beyond their expected life. I would find it hard to give this car up or switch to a different model entirely."

Sequoia's are my all-time fav vehicle, but I wanted to somewhat downsize. The MDX was a perfect fit because it allowed me to downsize from the huge Sequoia, but I didn't lose anything as far as vehicle quality. I do have to say that I'm VERY surprised that Acura/Honda didn't make this luxury vehicle to have mostly luxury options. For instance, the rear view mirror is not auto-dimming, and it does NOT even have the compass on it. Heck, my 2004 Toyota Sequoia even had that! I feel that they should've put in a V8 engine like the Sequoia's have. The Sequoia has MUCH more punch when putting the pedal to the medal. But instead, Acura puts in a V6 that REQUIRES you to use expensive premium fuel. Yes, it's NOT an option. The manual says you must use premium fuel or it will cause engine problems. The sunroof button is not very user friendly. Until you've had the car for awhile and get used to what the picture means on the button, you'll be fumbling with it like I still do after 3 months. :) The 2nd row could use better quality cup holders in the arm rest. The 3rd row could use better storage and cup holder options also. I ABSOLUTELY love the trim look and storage options in the front seat. It looks VERY sharp! You can even close a lid to hid the cup holders. I love that the console between the driver and passenger is also the armrest(s). Besides, separate arm rests always seem to crack because of your arms always being on them. Acura/Honda makes the console of very high quality materials and there's not a crack to be found from arms resting on it. The leather is VERY high quality. Not a crack to be found anywhere in this 2007 MDX! The 2nd row needs a console in the arm rest to give kids somewhere to put their stuff. Kids seem to stretch out the pockets on the back of the seats when they continually put stuff in them. I love that Sirius Satellite radio is an option on this vehicle! I've never had this before and I LOVE it. I need to renew quickly before my 3 mos. free subscription expires! I'd be lost without my HairNation and Ozzy's Boneyard stations!"

I never felt it was quite worth the sticker price, but Acura had never let me down - until now. I am currently in a state of shock and dismay after learning last week that the clunking sound coming form my right front end is a defective strut. The vehicle does have 101k miles on it so strut replacement did not seem unreasonable. I also was told that my rear struts are \"leaking\" and need to be replaced. The shock and dismay occurred when I was told by my nice service advisor that the 2007-2013 MDXs with the active dampening suspension require \"specialized\" electronic struts. Replacing all four will run about $4200. That's right - over four grand for strut replacement!!! No OEM options either. I was and still am in shock, that is almost 10% of purchase price. I then asked what would the cost be to replace all four struts if my car were a 2006 MDX w/o that particular suspension system. He looked it up and quoted me $1650. Now, that is a reasonable and customary cost. What an unbelievable difference in cost of ownership. Also, I could not get a any answer to my questions about disconnecting the active suspension and putting regular, traditional, non electronic struts on the vehicle. I am between a rock and a hard spot. I have owned 6 Acuras, have regularly recommended them to family and friends. I never will again. I really feel duped and taken by this atricious pricing, and, what is clearly a drastically over engineered suspension system and poor design decision by Acura that has rendered the MDX is a ticking time bomb for owners. If you have one of these MDXs, GET RID OF IT before you are stuck with this cost. DON\"T BUY USED unless you have a mechanic certify the struts have been replaced recently. I have been a loyal Acura owner, I think they need to reprice these replacements quickly as there are a lot of 2007-2013 MDXs on the road, and, along with incensing their owner community who are going to be stuck with outrageous repair bills, they are truly setting themselves up for severe damage to their brand. They have with me. I feel deceived. STAY AWAY from 2007-2013 MDX or risk a second mortgage to keep it running."

Even with high miles it is nearly impossible to tell this MDX is nearly 8 years old. It handles more like a sports sedan than a smaller SUV. The only real knock is the 3rd row seating is smallish and should not be used for anyone over 5' 8\" (my middle son's height). The mileage is better than most 6 cylinder engines and offers PLENTY of acceleration. I am looking forward to testing the SH-AWD in a Wisconsin winter. The controls are easy to read/relate and comfort was obviously considered in the design. All in all, it has been a great vehicle for the money spent."

Also when the car was filled up with gasoline, you could hear it swishing in the tank. Either they don't have baffles in the tank design or the gas tank was defective. In case your interested, the replacement cost for one front strut is $1300.00. A word to the wise, if you purchase an MDX get an extended warranty and have it check out by and independent garage."

Handling is very nice although a bit heavy for my wife. Styling is nice as well. We opted for the nav model, but would probably have purchased the base model after owning this one due to price.

What we like: Great looks Fun to drive Good performance Excellent features Third row seats Front seat comfort Decent gas mileage All wheel drive works great Hands free calling is very cool and works well Nav screen is easy to read and located in the proper place What we do not like. Second row seats are comfortable but do not recline, they only tilt back slightly We had to purchase an auto dimming rear view mirror as it is not standard equipment Stereo is good but not great Somewhat noisy climate control fan Seats are not full leather, only the seating surfaces, however the third row seat does have leather surfaces unlike other brands Nav works well, but does not always show the shortest routes Voice recognition takes practice Fuel door release broke after a few months Overall we would probably purchase this car again. We did get a big surprise when we went to our insurance agent. We have an excellent rating, but it costs us about a grand more a year because of the luxury status. Also parts are very expensive, but because it is a Honda product, it should not break very often. I would take a hard look at the new Buick or the Mazda if I had to do it over again, but resale would probably make the MDX my choice once again because I will own this car well over 100,000 miles and do not want to give it away when I am finished like I do with most domestic brands."

Frequently I have needs for 5 to 6 passengers (1 or 2 of which are usually kids) and the 3rd row comes in quite handy for such times. I am quite impressed with the road manners of the MDX and would say that it handles as well as my X5 did. Steering is precise and it corners with confidence with the sport package equipped model. Seating is comfotable and provides all with plenty of space. The navigation system is first class and user friendly, however, the touch screen in my wife's Acura TL is even better. The rear seat DVD entertainment package is great for keeping the little ones occupied without hearing, \"are we there yet?\". The styling of the previous model was unimpressive and bland to me, but this one is bold and masculine, especially with the sport package rims and sport running boards. Acura has done a great job and I find this to be a great compliment to our 2004 Acura TL and 2006 BMW 330i."

I drive a Lexus and when my wife and I were planning on purchasing a new suv for her, we first looked at Lexus. I am a huge Lexus fan but they currently do not offer anything that can compete with the MDX in price and performance. Advice to Lexus: add a 3rd row to the RX for those of us who don't like truck like suv's but still need 5-7 seat capacity. I did exhaustive research on the X5, XC90, Audi, LR3, etc. etc. Nothing beat this vehicle. Don't get me wrong these other vehicles are nice but a X5, for example, would have set us back an additional $15-20K and still would not have a usable 3rd row (very tiny). The MDX is luxurious and very practical for our family (3 kids). My wife is in love with this car! Amazing interior with technology galour. My wife is glad she has this car as it has functioned well as a family hauler but as soon as the kids are dropped off she is driving in style and loves the way Acura has designed a vehicle with that in mind. We are the type of family that likes quality and luxury but reliability is important as well and we feel proud to add an Acura to our garage along with our Lexus!!! My wife used to try and steal my car any chance she had now I am the one grabbing her keys!!! Thank you Acura for making IMHO the 2007 Luxury SUV of the Year!!!!"

Some believe not having a touch screen navigation is a down grade or worse than before. To me, this is absolutely not the case and more about people not understanding the system. Unlike center dash systems, the screen is on the top of the dash which greatly minimizes taking your eyes off the road. Of course, in this position it cannot be easily touched (so no touch screen). Once you get familiar with the control knob, it is quite easy to use. Upon learning the voice commands, just tell the system what to do?so why would it need to be touched? The stereo is awesome. I purchased the Tech and Sport model and believe there is a package upgrade (so I do not know about the base system). There is a PLII mode available for the XM radio which allows for 5.1 sound. The sound quality is absolutely amazing and I still find myself shaking my head and saying wow. All the functions on the radio are voice activated. If you want to change the station, just tell it. Want to listen to the channel 71 (jazz), just say ?XM 71?. Other advantages over the 2004 MDX included a 120 VAC power outlet, auto closing the rear door (no blown out ear drums from closing), and the blue tooth system. Some have complained about there not being a luggage rack but frankly in my 3 years with my 04 MDX I never used it. The luggage rack causes wind noise and reduces fuel efficiency so why make it a standard option. If you use the rack, install it as an option just like a towing hitch. The best part of the 2007 is the handling. Going around corners is a blast. I read some people complaining about the ride (not soft enough) and I thought my goodness they are nuts. Awesome ride, nothing that I test was better. Now, I do not know why Acura didn?t install the auto rearview mirror. But honestly with the rear tinted windows, I have never had to change the mirror when cars were behind me so I do not miss this feature. Here?s my final thought. My brother owns a Toyota Sequoia, my buddies drive a BMW X-5, Lexus 330 and Chevy Tahoe, and my sister drives a ML Mercedes (always in the shop) and whenever we go anywhere who?s rig does everyone want to take...the MDX."

I have been looking forward to my next MDX as I am completely in love with my 2002 which has met and surpassed all of my expectations. I had really been looking forward to the evaluating the new 2007 MDX. However, at day's end I felt really disappointed. What I liked: Intrumentaton was more modern. Higher rated towing capacity. Handling was improved. What I didn't: Cheaper feeling controls. Lower gas mileage (wrong direction!) The NAV system was an utter disappointment. Touch-screen is SO MUCH easier to work with and they did away with it. To make matters worse, the new screen is not as sharp or as bright as the old one. I tried adjusting it and was able to improve it slightly but still fiound myself disappointed. The one redeeming characteristic of the NAV system was a more accurate depiction of intersections than I have been accustomed to in my 2002 and also integration with traffic reporting. One other redeeming feature would be voice recognition, but it is my understanding that this is only available in some models. Note to ACURA: Go back to touch-screen NAV, make significant quality improvements, or both! I found the engine noisier and the ride rougher. I was surprised to find that my lower HP 2002 seems to accelerate better. I don't like the steering wheel which feels alot cheaper. The embedded controls are more difficult to work with. The sound system is not any better than the one in my 2002. The price is higher. The fuel mileage is lower. Features that were formerly standard are now high priced options (particularly the roof rack). I find myself wishing I had bought a 2006 before they made all these changes. While the 2007 is still a good vehicle with some improvements, overall this model is a disappointment. I'll probably wait to see what comes out in 2008. Don't get me wrong, this is a good vehicle. But they made the mistake of eliminating some of the competitive strengths. I have been spoiled by my 2002 which perhaps hightened my expectations of what I would find in the 2007 overhaul."

I was disappointed to learn that the 2007 MDX with tech package did not come with a rain sensing wind shield, roof rack, nor an automatic rear view mirror. These items were standard on the 2004-06 MDX Touring model. With the 2007 they are now listed as options. Granted the 2007 MDX Tech package comes with navigaiton, sattelite radio (90-days included with purchase) and a few other bells and wistles but everything else is optional. I also noticed that the floor mats are not quite up to the previous standards included in earlier models. Once again for an additional price you can purchase \"all weather\" floor mats. If this type of pricing and equiping becomes an Acura trend, this will be my last Acura until corporate gets it right (for the consumer)."

The stability is great when set on \"comfort\" but is way awesome when on the default \"sport \"mode.This thing on \"sport \"carves like a German sports sedan.The ride is excellent regardless,and the cabin is quiet.The optional sound system is among the best I have ever heard. I do suggest the sport package but will admit to not driving a base model yet. Fit,finish,ergonomics,styling are first rate. Predicted reliability should be great. This is our third MDX and we have NEVER had a mechanical problem. Our last one was badly crashed. Vehicle had major damage .All airbags deployed. My wife emerged with only one bruise in her arm ,a tribute to the safety or last years model. Improvements have been made to this one. I am happy to know that my wife and my 5 year old son are riding in a very safe vehicle. The suspension should help in accident avoidance. Compared to the european SUV's it is a geat value. The engine is great and has a healthy exaust note that is gratifying but not overly intrusive. It is not a V8 and it is a big heavy vehicle. 2 lane road close passes are best done on manual mode at high revs (but shift before that rev limiter kicks in). 4th gear is rather tall. A 6 th gear would do wonders to narrow the gaps. Sports mode should increase rpm's shift points to maximize power without needing a larger more expensive engine. Other vehicles such as my Audi A4 have that characteristic,and make the daily commute more exciting(but is to be used sparingly to get better fuel economy). My wife and 90% of the poplation will say it is more than adequately powered and no additional gearing or transmission characteristic options are desired. I can't imagine a better SUV at any price point, and especially at it's current price point. The fact that next year Honda will unveil a similar Pilot for thousands less makes me feel some concern for the viability of our our US auto industry."

My MDX has never been rattle-free. The right front door started to rattle the next day after the car was delivered. After the door was fixed, the sunroof and the front passenger seat started to rattle. After these were fixed, the dashboard started to rattle. After 4 trips back to the dealer in 6 weeks, I don?t want to go back again. I am totally disappointed. There are other problems besides the rattles. The AC compressor makes a loud thump when it starts, and it can repeat the start-and-stop cycle several times when you wait for the green light. The thumps are very annoying. The transmission makes knocking noises when both speed and rpm are low as if it were a 10,000-mile-old transmission. The back of the car produces a click sound when any of the doors is shut closed. The last 2 problems were considered ?normal? by the dealer. I didn?t believe so until I got a loaner 2007 MDX which had the same problems. I guess the transmission knocking sound and the clicking sound from the back are commonly seen in MDXs. The following is my opinions about the various aspects of the car. The exterior looks good, but it looks very much like the CR-V. The car is fast and steady although a bit slow from the light. Fuel economy is also good considering the sizes of the car and the engine. I get an average of 19.4 miles per gallon for half city and half highway driving. Noises from the tires are loud. The steering wheel should be redesigned because the bottom part is hard to grab and the control buttons on the bottom part are awkward to reach. The audio system needs a stronger base. The real-time traffic often doesn?t tell you which way and which lanes are affected by the accident. Some street names in New Jersey couldn?t be found in the navigation system. A park listed in the navigation system didn't exist. Here is a tip for finding streets. If you want to find street names like ?South Cleveland?, search for ?Cleveland?. Voice command works fine, but it never worked when I tried to call somebody. The tire pressure monitor system displayed ?tire pressure okay? even when the pressure was 4 psi below recommendation. I am not sure if my car came with a low tire pressure because I just figured out how to get the readings yesterday."

I drive a Tahoe, which provides plenty of room, so I suggested lets get another SUV and my wife gleefully agreed. However, she then went on to express her disdain for driving an SUV as big as the Tahoe. So still needing a vehicle bigger then a car but not as big as a Tahoe we happily agreed on, what I like to refer to as, a Jr. SUV. With my conviction on a GM product and the fact that the Cadillac Jr SUV received great reviews I thought it was a shoe in. My wife though, being a big Honda fan, had other plans. So we ventured onto the Honda dealer and we both agreed that the Pilot is a no go and no way are we driving a minivan. She then said \"Hey Acura is made by Honda. Let's take a look at them\" I of course resisted but she was big on the 07 MDX. It looked a lot better then the Pilot and offered quite a bit more so we began to compare. We looked at several others such as the Volvo and Saab but none compared. I never thought I would say this and I know that my wife isn't going to be reading this so it' ok to admit but this is the best vehicle purchase I have ever been a part of. We have had it for almost a month and yes I do make up excuses in order to drive it. I still enjoy my Tahoe but driving the 07 MDX is absolute LUXURY in an SUV. Oh yeah, and don't listen to the sales reps. You can tell a big difference between comfort and sport suspension. Which by the way are both great. I like the sport and she prefers comfort. Two thumbs up babe you were right. You sure make a good-looking car look even better."

I decided on the MDX as I was completely amazed at its ability to handle corners and the motor was responsive and smooth plus sounds really great. This is the wife's car, but gentlemen you'll want to take this rig for a spin every chance you get. I purchased the entertainment package and although the jury still out there on the high cost, the system is fantastic and high quality. The kids are completely quiet and I can listen to a ballgame via the XM radio without them complaining, \"Dad do we have to listen to the game\"? Guys, the stereo is quality (yes loud) and has lots of bass but the wife prevents me from cranking it up with the kids which is probably a good thing. I liked the Navigation system screen up high rather than in the middle of the dash because it is easer to see while driving and the backup camera display works well while coordinating looking at the mirrors. The voice activation system works great. It allows changing interior temperature (either passenger or driver) by just asking it too. The Navigation system can be changed by the voice commands as well. Making phone calls via the Bluetooth interface system is an absolute must for drivers who phone and drive. Ladies, just leave your phone in your purse as this car tells you whose calling and will answer or make calls for you. My only minor complaint is the instrument dash is a little dramatic with the round cylinders sticking out a little and the steering wheel although functional lacks the styling that it should. The triangular silver piece surrounding the center section gives the appearance of being cheap. At this price, the auto rear view mirror should not be an option and should be included as standard. I love the rest of the interior and find it completely awesome. One of my main objections over some of the other vehicles is they lacked a third row seat. Why have a SUV that only seats 5...go buy a AWD car instead. Let's face it, the back seats in all the mid size SUV's are best suited for the kids/teens and this third row (especially with a movie on) has the kids fighting who gets to get in the back. In my experience, this rig is the best SUV on the market. Hope this information helps you. Best regards and God Bless!"

The miles scared me a little bit but the one owner car has all of the service records from the Acura dealership and runs great. My last car was a BMW X5 and that thing was a money pit! Constant repairs. This Acura has all of the features that the BMW had (heated leather seats, rear view camera, bluetooth, etc) with a 6 cylinder, 24 valve V Tech engine that is as fast as the BMW V8 engine at about half the cost of gasoline. Don't let the high miles scare you. These guys only purchase vehicles that meet their strict guidelines. They have been in the business for many decades and they know how to pick good cars. I waited 2 months before putting this review and I like the car even more than when I first purchased it. No problems at all. Keep up the good work guys. It's hard to find trustworthy dealers anymore."

              "review_text": "I purchased my 2006 Acura MDX Touring in Salt Lake City, UT back in late December 2008 as an Acura Certified Pre-Owned vehicle. It had about 32,000 miles on it at the time. The battery died the following day, but the car dealer (Mike Hale Acura) replaced it for free, no questions asked. My only concern with the car then was the original owner never installed the optional Acura MDX towing package, including transmission cooler, yet installed an after-market tow hitch and was pulling a boat around with the vehicle. I've never used the tow hitch for anything except my bike rack and up to 5 bicycles. Now (May 2019) at 145,000+ miles, I've never had any transmission issues / problems. I have replaced all of my engine and transmission mounts, shocks, struts, engine battery (twice), power steering column, tires (twice), front brake pads, rear brake pads (twice), timing belt, platinum tipped spark plugs, etc., and I religiously follow Acura's recommended service schedule for driving in severe conditions. For the last 3-1/2 years I've been driving in the very hot and dusty Phoenix, AZ metro area. I really like this vehicle. I've found it to be safe, pretty reliable, and practical. It's been the best all-around car I've ever owned (out of 1974 Buick LeSabre, 1979 Honda Accord hatchback, 1986 Mitsubishi Starion ESI-R, 1992 Honda Accord EX sedan, 2000 Acura 3.2 TL, 2008 Toyota Camry XLE v6). A car is not an investment, it's a necessary liability. Like any car, if you don't neglect it, and you don't abuse it, it should treat you well. It's just that Toyotas and Hondas typically treat owners better over the long haul than any other car make, IMHO."

The seats are very comfortable. It gets decent gas mileage for an SUV in my opinion. The fold away third row seating is fantastic! The only two things I would even remotely classify as items to be improved upon would be perhaps a couple inches more leg room in the driver seat and front seat overall. And the blind spots seem wider than in other SUVs. I had a Jeep Grand Cherokee before my MDX and the blind spots seemed much smaller.

That said, we have had the following problems: -- the brake rotors are clearly undersized and prone to warping. We have had to get them recut or replaced four times. -- the dash vents are flimsy, and three out of the four have broken over the years -- the AC system recently developed a leak and lost its refrigerant charge. Our local (excellent) mechanic could not locate the leak with either a leak detector or using the dye method. He recharged the system, it seemed to be working well, but lost its charge again after one month -- every few months since new, the stability control warning light comes on when the car has been parked overnight. Stopping the car, turning the engine off, and restarting corrects the problem. Nothing seems to be wrong with the system, and no diagnositc code is recorded."

              "review_text": "Bought this SUV used from a private seller, got it for $2,800 Canadian. We flew down to pick it up and drove it 900 Kms back to where we live. My first impression of this 15 year old SUV was it was in pretty great shape. Body looked very good and the interior was beautiful. Only complaint is the Nav screen had a big black circle blob, but I could still read the time and and it didn't block any important information. Driving it back home was such a treat. This SUV has power and then some to pass and go up hills without a hiccup. Gas mileage was awesome for a V6. Filled it full twice for the 900km trip home. Very roomy and comfortable seats. We have owned this for a year now and we have probably replaced almost everything on it. Radiator, brakes, power steering lines, power steering O-ring, as it was whining and that was a cheap fix. Gaskets etc. We live in Northern BC Canada and the winters are long and harsh. So putting this SUV to the ultimate test up here was a experience. The gear shifter would get stiff and had to be lubricated twice so far, I'm sure we will need to replace the cable as lubing it sometimes helps. Minus all the fixing. Motor runs quiet and amazing with having 250 thousand Kms on it driving in winter ice and deep snow was challenging. Got used to how it handles pretty quick. We have dry snow and cold winters not wet and sloppy conditions. And it handled it fairly well. Excellent tires make a huge improvement with how it handles. Put on some Cooper's ATs and it handles great. No hydroplaning, and so far we have hit Nov. And just got some ice on our roads and it doesn't even slide. May still put on some studded winters but so far these Cooper tires are holding up nicely. It came with no block heater so we had to install one of those too. I'd have to say in really taking care of it we have put in close to 2k in parts to help maintain it, as previous owner never really seemed to replace or fix problems. I'd honestly recommend this SUV for new drivers and or people who live in varying conditions or who want a reliable SUV. If maintained properly and regularly. I was a bit caught off guard though with having to fill it with premium gas only!!! But I understand because of the type of motor it has and that too should never ever be compromised, don't fill it with regular gas as it can cause a whole lot of issues."

Gas mileage is fair as we average about 18 mixed driving. We are very happy since we bought this great car for thousands less than a comparable new one.

I believe I will easily be able to drive this care for another 100K. I pull a small trailer (PWC) and have loaded the vehicle with people and this car simply does everything we need.

Though living in Arizona with 115 degree summers, running it 24/7 maybe contributed to that. Acura's Navigation is sourced from Alpine and is the best in the industry (says JD Powers).

So California... five lanes of traffic moving at about 75 miles per hour. I pointed out some new homes off to the side of the road to my wife and we both took our eyes off of the road. When I turned back... all five lanes of cars were stopped... about 250 feet in front of us. Luckily the other drivers to our right... we were in the fast lane... had been paying attention and were slowing down way behind us. I jammed my foot on the brake... could feel the pedal pulsing as the ABS did it's job. No slide... no tire noise... but we were not stopping in time. I made a panic 90 degree turn to right... under full breaking and deceleration... we turned... and at the side of the road... still under full breaking and deceleration... made a second 90 degree turn to the left and came to a stop on the right shoulder... just to the right of about the third car in. We could not believe how the vehicle stability worked. I can't imaging any other car I've ever owned stopping us safely. It was amazing... scary... in fact terrifying. It has never had any work done other than scheduled maintenance... looks... feels... drives... like new. This is a wonderful car."

              "review_text": "This is my first luxury SUV I've ever owned, and hopefully my last! I've owned a '94 Toyota Camry, a '95 Honda Accord, and a '93 Chevrolet Suburban, and extensively driven plenty of other vehicles. My MDX has 136,000 miles and gets 18mpg in the city and 23mpg on the interstate. For potential buyers, I'll list some of the pros and cons of this vehicle. Pros Steering & Handling: I live in a mountain region so the exceptionally tight steering and suspension are put to use on a regular basis. Also, Acura used a shorter, wider wheelbase for this vehicle which shortens the turning radius and makes the vehicle VERY easy to maneuver in the city. Interior: The leather, in spite of being 7 years old, has held up nicely. The local climate is very dry so I recently started using a leather conditioner. Some nice features are the third row seat, the ease at folding the seats up and down to take advantage of the massive cargo area, and the additional power outlets in the jockey box and rear cargo area. A very well thought-out interior. AWD: This system is managed by the car computer and sends most of the power to the front wheels. When slippage occurs, power is automatically transferred to the rear wheels. Snowy and icy roads are the norm here for 4 months out of the year and the system performs very well under these adverse conditions. Honorable mentions: Bose 9 speaker sound system, V-TEC engine, Sun Roof, Heated Seats (a must in cold climates) and all the other standard included features. Cons Ride: The downside of a tight suspension is that rough roads can make for a rough ride. Also I had to rebuild most of the front suspension at 120,000 miles. Noise: On smooth roads, the noise is negligible, unless there is wind. With rough roads and/or wind, be prepared to put in the earplugs! Hill Climbing All of the great features on this vehicle do add quite a bit of weight, and getting this car up a hill requires a LOT of gas. It will climb okay, but be prepared to sacrifice your gas mileage. That's pretty much it for the cons. On a scale of 1-10 I would give this vehicle an 8.5"

That would be expectable if this was a Ford, but I expected to see this car go at least 150,000 before I had to change the tranny. After reading up on the Acura \"blogs\", I now find out that Acura had increased the size of the engine, thereby cutting back on the size of the tranny. The '02 & '03 Acura's are apparently known for this problem. Unfortunately, Acura doesn't want to hear about the problem. I am now shopping for that Toyota I should have purchased 4 years ago."

We quickly found out how difficult is was to find a luxury mid-size SUV with a third row. We really wanted a BMW X5, but of course no third row until 2007. The MDX is really nice, but an absolute gas hog. Just a little drive from the suburbs into the city and back again, you are looking at about 1/4 tank of gas. We are getting 14.9 city and 17.6 highway. With the price of gas these days, I recommend getting a luxury 4-door car, a smaller CRV-type, or gasp, a mini-van. It's not that this MDX isn't a beautiful car, but with the price of gas and the environmental concerns, I recommend buying something with a higher mpg."

Of course, in 2020 the car does not look like a modern car, but its look is simple enough, and had been copied enough that the car will continue to age well. Maintenance is not cheap when performed by Acura, but the local one at least stood by their work and their car. When the tranny failed after 8 years, they replace it at no cost to us.

From the day I bought my MDX, certified used with 50k, its poor overall quality has been apparent. Dont get me wrong, its not a Ford, but a luxury vehicle its not. A/C was the first to go out, 2 months after buying. Moisture runs in the window shaft during rain, snow, or after car wash and then gets the inside of the window wet if you roll the window down, which when in the winter when salt dries inside the window is pretty annoying. Trannie issues, rattling issues, and gas tank clunking. All of which Im told from dealer are \"characteristic\" of the MDX and there's nothing to be done. Im told these problems were fixed in later model years."

The ride is quite comfortable and yet it handles as well as a sporty car. There's barely any lean on turn, and it simply sticks to the road. The thing that really stands out to me is how well everything works. Well over 100K and the seats are still great, not too mushy. Everything works perfectly. Every button, every lever, everything you touch is solid. Even opening and closing the windows and moonroof is a joy. There is a wonderful solid thud with each window/door/lock and every power option is trust inspiring. Make no mistake, this is not a Bentley, or a Porsche, but it is about as good in every area as a car can be. One note: '01-'02 MDX/Pilot/Odyssey had a tranny problem from design. You can go to Acura's website and enter your vin, and it will tell you if the recall was taken care of. Most had a jet oil kit installed to get fluid to the 2nd gear which was burning out too soon. That being said, 95% of these vehicles have been fine. Most of the others had the trannys replaced under the extended warranty, or quite often Honda has split the cost to install a reman. Your absolute worst case scenario would be a tranny replacement at a cost of roughly $3000. But remember, most MDXs are perfectly fine, and that $3K is mostly already reflected in the resale value. You can pick up a good '01 for about $10K, which is significantly less than you would pay for anything else that would even come close to the quality of this vehicle. Also, it's my experience that Acura/Honda takes great pride in their reliability ratings, and will almost always offer some concession to ensure the owner is satisfied. Buy it, you'll love it."

The 3rd Gen MDX has a long history of ZF transmission issues. They rarely fail completely, but they are known to shift poorly under certain circumstances. MDX owners just learn to live with it for the most part, but it's a noticeable shortcoming on an otherwise stellar drivetrain. The Hybrid version of this vehicle has a different transmission and frankly operates in a different manner than standard AWD SUV's. Having three electric motors assisting the drivetrain at various points illustrates how complex the Hybrid MDX's propulsion system can be. The system although powerful at 300 Hp is not seamless and linear in it's acceleration. The engine and electric motors combined are all applied in hard acceleration but there are distinct surges in the powerband that you can feel. Reminiscent of a transmission slip but not exactly. Acura must be aware of this glitch and issued a TSB that is supposed to address it. So with that said the MDX Hybrid is a really good SUV with some issues in it's complex drivetrain. The ultimate reliability will be determined as we surge and slip into the future."

First off is Acura\u2019s great CPO program. Next is the refined styling and features (I have the Advanced package). The hybrid engine is smooth and I get from 24-27 mpg in combined driving. The acceleration and shifting is very smooth (I think my wife likes my Acura better than her 450h as she is very complimentary of the vehicle when she get in). The adaptive cruise is OK but I find it a little awkward and I am OK not using for the few times I am on the open road. I find the engine shut off at stops to very responsive when I accelerate and I don\u2019t even realize it is present (maybe that\u2019s the benefit of the hybrid vs the non-hybrid model). The Sh-AWD works very well in the CO snow and I have no problems getting anywhere. Originally looked at other brands (Audi, BMW, Lexus) but glad I found Acura and the Sport Hybrid MDX. Would gladly buy again. One item of note is the Hybrid is NOT for towing! If you want to pull anything, might need something else."

I came across this vehicle in my search, unaware that Acura even made an MDX in a hybrid variant. I decided to go test drive a new one locally at my Acura dealer. I was simply stunned at how Honda engineers had put this SUV package together from the NSX super car. It was amazing. I love the seemingly endless smooth power from the 3.0 V6 engine and dual clutch transmission. Having owned Lexus hybrid SUV\u2019s they seem downright anemic compared to this car. It is definitely sporty and fun to drive this 4,500 pound SUV around town or up in the mountains. It handles much better than the Lexus on dirt and gravel roads with the super handling all wheel drive (independent electric motors at each rear wheel allow one wheel to have power while potentially braking the other in turns). I can\u2019t wait to try it out in the snow. The best part of all of this is how the car seamlessly transitions from the gas engine to the three electric motors without even a shudder. The only indication you get is the tachometer drops to zero and the quiet ride. I handily beat the EPA estimates of 26/27 mpg and usually get 32 mpg in mixed highway and city driving, and have even attained 34 mpg on a tank. Expect about 30 mpg on a constant cruise at 75 mph. I have surpassed 500 miles on several tanks with over three gallons of gas remaining, so 600 miles is possible - take that Tesla! Your bladder will give out long before the car needs gas! All of this power and luxury with top notch safety features. I love the lane keep assist and lane departure warning paired with the radar cruise control. It\u2019s like semi autonomous driving. I drove from St Louis to Denver by myself in about 12 1/2 hours and felt like I had an auto pilot guiding me the whole way. Simply amazing. I also like the surround view cameras and the Milano leather seats which are so comfortable. The ELS sound system is amazing, and once you get used to the two screens for NAV and the radio/climate control, you won\u2019t even blink. Apple Play came out in 2018, and is the only thing I would like, but that a pretty minor thing compared to the great value this car offers in a used vehicle. I picked my up as a CPO car from an Acura dealer, with just 16,000 miles on it, and it feels like a new car to me. Finally, the cavernous three row seating and cargo area holds 91 cu ft of stuff. It beat the Lexus by about 15 cu ft, and is only 4 cu ft smaller than a Tahoe. That is what really sealed the deal for me. I needed extra space to be able to clean and service our VRBO rental, and this vehicle performs in every way. Do yourself a favor and test drive this car. I think you\u2019ll be glad you did. I felt like we would never go off of Toyota/Lexus again after having owned three Lexus and three Toyota\u2019s, but I have to say, the Honda engineers really outdid themselves with this one."

The range of seat adjustment doesn?t work well for 6 ft seasoned driver. Another major disappointment is in th infotainment package. Two displays are unneeded and confusing especially if you consider the instrument panel as a third. The user interface is really a mess of extra steps to achieve adjustments. The technology is amazingly slow for being dubbed ?Advanced Technolgy? The Honda Pilot and Odyssey are way ahead with a single display and Apple Car Play. Honda link and other technology becomes another confusing mess of logging and passwords. Been in the game too long to have premium auto with this level of issues.

The NSX has the most streetable power, torque, and driving characteristics of any competitor outside a 911 Turbo S, but doesn't look like every other boring Porsche. Stoplight to stoplight it is a bolt of lightning with the hybrid motors providing instant torque and removing turbo lag! Plus, you can fit a set of golf clubs in the trunk which can't be said for ANY other supercar! I drove mine 2,300+ miles in 3 days and at 6'4\" tall I was still comfortable. The varied driving modes are really nice. The car has a distinct personality in each mode, though I don't use Sport ever really. Unlike some cars it is not always \"on\" so you can drive it and chill or flip it into Track mode and summon demons from its soul. I really wouldn't change anything except maybe making the trunk better insulated from exhaust heat. The Infotainment system is fine as it accepts Car Play and Android Auto. There is a volume knob on the wheel that I use so I can't complain about the slider (which is a dumb complaint in my opinion). The exhaust sounds nice in Sports Plus and Track but is not an obnoxiously loud as some. Then again, this isn't a car you buy to draw attention to you by being neon colored and obnoxiously loud. Real engine sounds are piped into the cabin and you can easily take a business call if you put it in Quiet mode. Overall, I could not be happier with the car. Much is made about the interior, but I think Alcantara, carbon fiber, and leather are nice and it will age well unlike the tacky interiors of some. If you're considering buying one, do yourself one favor. Find one they rent at a track rental company like the one in Vegas and give it a go around the track in Track mode. Track mode (which I use on the street 90% of the time) is where the supercar character really shines. Don't bother with Sport as it is underwhelming and the worst of Quiet and Sport Plus modes in my opinion. Oh and the NSX can be seen beating Aventadors, GTRs including the Nismo, Teslas, Huracans, 488s, AMG GTs, and more in real life drag races on YouTube if you doubt its quickness! She is a keeper boys!"

However, unlike the original NSX, this one is not for the DIYer. You need to take it to the dealer. Even an oil change involves a lift, 7 different drain plugs (!), etc. And if you track the car, the ceramic brake rotors are very expensive to replace, so in my view, the new car is more delicate and less robust than the old one.

I was very impressed by the overall fit and finish and the simplicity of setting the four driving modes. With the dynamic mode set to track the car is seriously fast. The ride is the most impressive part. With the dynamic mode set to sport the car rides better than most if not all other sports cars. I would not hesitate drive this car across country. There is no storage space anywhere in the main cabin other than a place to put down your phone. There is a cupholder attachment stored in the clove box for two cups but it restricts the passenger's space and comfort. The Acuralink is primitive by todays standards set by every other high end manufacturer. Comparing the Acuralink app to the one in our TESLA and the I8 we traded for this car it is several years behind. This is a big surprise as the Hybrid system is seamless and the start stop function is less obnoxious than most cars using a stop start system to save gas. We don't baby the car and we are averaging over 23 MPG which is impressive numbers for a 570 HP sports car."

Exhaust sound is OK, would be nicer if it were deeper sound but still unique to a sports car. All buttons and function in cabin is great, not difficult to find anything and also has a great ride, unlike viper or base Vette. Great car to get in and cruise without worry."

              "review_text": "Let's start with what it isn't: - It isn't a supercar. At least by the standards of today. 290 hp was pretty good back in 2001, but now is less than a current Nissan 370Z, or a Porsche Cayman S, or a BMW Z4. And it's WAY below a Corvette or a 911 or a Ferrari. So if you have to have the fastest car around, don't buy an NSX. - It isn't an investment-type car. While they hold their value pretty well, I don't see them ever appreciating like a classic Ferrari. - They aren't cheap to repair. They are VERY reliable, but when things need fixing, and eventually something will need fixing (especially with an older NSX) the parts and labor aren't cheap. Now let's talk about what it IS: - It's one of the best looking cars out there. Period. It's an elegant and timeless design that will still be just as gorgeous 20 years from now. - It's a wonderful compromise for a sports car. Enough HP to go 0-60 in 5 sec. (That's fast enough for me) yet I can easily get 18 mpg or better in city (Chicago) driving. Try getting that kind of mileage in a Ferrari! It's comfortable enough for a long trip, yet feels perfectly at home on a race track (which I've done). It's exhilarating to drive, yet easy to drive (it's 6-speed is as easy and slick as my old Miata). If you want to putter around town it will drive and act like any Acura, but when you want a thrill, take it up to it's 8000 rpm redline - the sound is AMAZING! To summerize, the best description I can give for this car is it's very Porsche 911-like with exotic looks and the reliablility of an Acura. If that idea appeals to you then by all means buy one. You won't regret it."

Little has changed about the styling other than the color-matched tops for the '95+ models and of course, the T-top. The 2000 model has power-assist steering at lower speeds which adds to its comfort-factor. Though comfortable for long rides, I was always less than impressed with the interior styling. It seemed like a car with its high price tag and such brilliant exterior styling would have a striking interior to match. Regardless, the balance and handling of the NSX makes you feel like you're riding on rails and more than makes up for any lack in interior styling. My positive experience with the performance of my 2000 NSX-T could only be overshadowed by its reliability."

Initially I was interested in a 2019(new design), but had difficulty finding one in the color of our choice. My wife and I enjoy this vehicle for its appearance/styling, handling, low cabin noise and performance. We test drove a '19 Mazda CX-5 turbo, '18 BWW X1, '18 Audi Q5, '21 Audi Q3, and a '19 Lexus NX300. We felt the RDX had the best ride and most quiet engine especially under heavy acceleration. The Q5 was close, but preferred the more modern interior cabin design of the Acura. I have watched numerous car review videos of the RDX and the two most common complaints were of the touch pad system and the apparent difficulty of the transmission hunting to find the appropriate gear. We have found that both of these have not been an issue. After about a week of driving we mastered the touch pad and the transmission shifts seamlessly while in comfort mode in city driving. Thus far this has been an excellent vehicle after driving approximately 1000 miles. I look forward to driving this vehicle(wife is main driver) and I drive a '16 BMW 340i with manual transmission. It is interesting how one can become biased watching or reading reviews without even having driven the vehicle-need to drive and test all of them. I like the fact that the RDX was designed and built in the US."

I liked Mercedes GLC and Audi Q5 but those are a bit expensive. I don't like BMW X3 and Lexus NX looks. I started looking for something that's fun to drive but not too pricey either. I liked RDX 2020 when I drove it and it's cheaper than GLC and Q5. So I ended up buying 2020 RDX SH-AWD A-Spec. Based on 3 weeks of ownership Pros: Performance (sports mode is pretty good and it handles curve nicely), Styling (good exterior design although A-Spec should offer more), Comfort, Panoramic Sunroof, Decent Interior (it's not the best but RDX is cheaper than most of the competitors), Android Auto (my last car didn't have it), 10.2\" Center Display (personally I don't like in dash display). Cons: Fuel Economy (15 mpg, mostly city driving of 200 miles), Styling (I wish A-Spec would come with black side mirrors, black roof and black emblems/badges), No auto fold side mirrors, Blind Spot assist is not on the side mirrors. It's early for me to comment on reliability. Given the price compared to other competitors, RDX is fun to drive, good looking and comfortable. So far I'm happy with my decision to buy my first Acura."

I've waited 6 months to do this review because I think you need to spend some time in a vehicle before you rate it. It has taken me some time to get used to the features on this car, and the item I hate the most is the fact that unless you push the button, the car turns off at every stop sign, stop light, etc., so you can't just crawl forward in line. The other most disappointing factor is the seat comfort. After an hour on the road, it starts to feel like you're sitting on a rock. I picked one of the gray shades, and since it's the most popular car color right now, I have trouble finding my gray car among all the others in the parking lot. The exterior styling is so similar to so many other cars that it's hard to locate mine. The engine noise is much louder than my Lexus, and Acura recommends that you use premium fuel in a 4 cylinder engine. For the price, I wish I would have shopped around more."

I was looking into purchasing a Hyundai Santa Fe and test drove it before any other vehicle. While the car was impressive, providing excellent features and good value for the price, I wasn\u2019t too impressed with the ride itself, particularly the horsepower. The deal involving the Sante Fe fell through so I kept on with my search. Having done extensive research on all SUV segments and SUV\u2019s within my price range I decided to look into the RDX. I test drove the vehicle and really fell in love with it. I was never the biggest Acura fan but they have knocked it out of the park with this SUV. The interior is luxurious with premium quality. The infotainment system needs a little getting use to but once all is figured out it is second nature afterwards. The SH-AWD technology Acura provides with their vehicles brings the fun factor to another level. It has the best handling of any vehicle I have ever owned or leased. Exterior has a cool look to it with chrome along the doors and front bumper. The RDX is comfortable with plenty of leg room space in the front and back seats. The price of the vehicle with the features you get is definitely a bargain in this luxury SUV segment. Many companies like Mercedes, Audi, BMW and others overcharge for various trim levels by adding just a few features to each trim. While shopping various SUV\u2019s segments including economy and luxury many vehicles carried little to no horsepower, so for me that became a deal breaker. I wanted something that I can drive every day and have occasional fun with. As for trim levels, I ended up with the tech package AWD. I would say the A-SPEC trim is the sweet spot but it does not come with a spare tire. That is something that may be able to get negotiated into the deal. My Fianc\u00e9e purchased a 2020 Lexus NX 300 recently and the RDX is by far the better vehicle and bargain all things considered. You can\u2019t go wrong with the 2020 Acura RDX."

First off the brakes started squeeking after 3500 miles which for me is unexceptable. Brought it to the delearship and they advise that this was an issue on the 2020 model. They've change the front and rear brakes. Everything was awsome until the next week when the brakes started squeeking again. It stops after a minute or so but still it's annoying. The stop engine at a red light never works. Delearship told me that the battery needs to be fully charge in order to work and many other factors may cause this technology to fail. I use the car everyday and in perfect weather conditions an still it doesnt work. White noise coming out of the speakers after the car has been stop for over half an hour. This may drain the battery. Last but not least, okay our roads here in Canada are not perferct but still this car is suppose to be a smoothe ride and I have notice some rattles from the dash and the hatchback which can become annoying. I turn up the music volume which is not great in order to block the rattles. Other than this it rides great. Not the best fuel effecienty but I guess this is not the reason you buy an rdx. Comfort and performance are great and the sound system is incredible. Overall if you don't mine the cons go for it. I've learn to live with it but pretty sure i'll be giving back this car after the lease and maybe before."

Many of the competitors (Audi, Mercedes, Volvo) depreciate greatly when they get close to warranty expiring because the cost of maintenance. Some things that this vehicle is lacking is folding mirrors, more of a usable navigation system (it's ok with a phone connected) With the a spec package you don't get a spare tire just a flat fix kit that will only work for small holes in the tire so for a larger puncture you wait for a tow truck. another issue for me is you have to pay for oil changes in comparison Volvo gives you three years free services as others also do this for free. Another issue is if you have a warranty issue Acura might not give you a loaner car where as 90 % of the competitors will, the good news is this is a very reliable vehicle. In summery do your home work if your trading in your vehicle know the trade in value (use Kelly blue book) not the dealers on line valuator) if they bring up reconditioning fees the trade in should be considered in excellent condition ."

Upgraded infotainment with Apple car play is perfect for us, safety features are must have for us as we have a 10 year old son. Overall we couldn\u2019t be happier.

Hard to key an address. The voice system takes too long and often won't find the location. EX: Was looking for street number 20178. Kept finding 2017A. Had to repeat three times. Last time shouting the number. They did away w/the CD Player, so had to load on a USB stick. More often than not the car won't find the USB stick. When it does, no easy way to play songs in a folder.

I could gripe about the infotainment system, which is overly complicated, but I realized that I can easily access everything I need via the heads-up display. That alone was worth the Advance package premium. Otherwise, there were minor glitches that required a dealer fix - the heated steering wheel that didn't heat - and a software update to fix a balky navigation system. And there was the weird discovery that my new iPhone can interfere with the touch-unlock of the doors. Sometimes I have to hold my phone behind my back to open the driver's door. The push-button transmission needs some getting used to, too, but you have to get used to new systems in any car. I wish the Acura had used fold-back door mirrors, though - they're expensive to replace. But, weigh the pros and cons, and unless you have to have a luxury badge to go with the luxury you can get in the Acura, and are willing to pay the extra freight for the same features, this car is well worth the money."

Panel gaps and alignments are not up to Japanese standards. Not a deal breaker for me, but take a close look at any unit you are considering and make your own call. Interior and exterior design is very nice and materials are quite good. Nice suite of safety features, but no blind-spot monitoring. Expect it in a car costing $40K. Instrument panel and infotainment systems have a learning curve. The panel could use a digital speedometer display, an easy software patch. Would like the option to purchase navigation which would be easy since the car has wi-fi connectivity for software updates. Seats are comfortable for long road trips and the cabin reasonably quiet. Engine and transmission work well together. Sport+ driving mode is a lot of fun. Handles well, but no BMW. In Sport or Comfort modes, steering is a little dead on center. Car drives \"big\" for a compact. Good sight lines, but the vehicle not as agile as X3 of Q5. Developed suspension noise at around 7K miles which dealer tracked down to loose nut not properly torqued during build. Again not to Japanese standards. Mileage below EPA ratings, 17-18 in town and 25 on the road. Seems like good value for the money."

It's not as quiet on the highway as a Lexus RX, but getting both qualities in the same vehicle is probably impossible. I have the Advance trim model with SH-AWD, which offers almost every feature you could want as standard. The seats are great, with 16 way adjustments for both the driver and passenger. The storage area behind the second row is good for a vehicle of its size, plus there is a hidden under floor area as well. Flip the rear seats down, and you can carry all types of bulky things. Performance is very good, although the transmission can be a bit jerky in the 1-2 and 2-3 upshift under moderate acceleration. Gas mileage is about 23 mpg mixed town and urban driving; the best I have ever gotten was 27 mpg, the worst about 19 mpg. The quality of the audio system is very good, and the 360 degree camera system is awesome. My car was made during the first few months of production in the summer of 2018, and required a lot of software updates to the infotainment system during the first 6-9 months of ownership. Things have settled down now, and the dreaded \"updating\" message that never went away is in the past. What could Acura do to make it 5 stars? Here are a few starting points: First, add power folding outside mirrors to cars for the US market; Canadian cars get them, as do most of the cars in the segment they compete in. The heated steering wheel is a dealer option for lower trim models; make it an option for all models and give me the power mirrors! I live in Florida and have only turned it on once in 18 months of ownership, just to see how warm it gets - it gets warm quick. Second, add the remote engine start feature to the key fob. We also own a 2017 Honda CR-V Touring, and Honda includes this feature on the fob as standard. Acura makes you pay for a somewhat pricey and glitchey app to get this feature, or pay the dealer $400 or so for a fob that includes this feature. Third, get rid of the fake engine sounds that get piped into the cabin, especially in the Sport and Sport + settings; it's even there in the Comfort mode upon acceleration. The advance trim level offers adjustable dampers, which is good, but leave out the fake engine sounds (or make it sound like an Acura NSX). I hope this helps. So, a solid 4 Stars, and I would buy it again"

ACC (automatic cruise control) with 'follow me' does work BUT you have to be careful when you actually stop. If the car ahead turns, the ACC immediately tries to accelerate you from stop to max speed setting, so you have to remember to turn it off. Lane Departure is TERRIBLE. It has swept me into the other lane without warning, it can't find the edges of the lane with any degree of accuracy. If you want to exit your lane, better use your turn signal or the car will try to prevent you and significantly impact turning - first time scared me. It also falsely will detect a car in lane next to you as moving into your lane and hit the brakes, could be worse with blind spot - don't know. It's not perfect so I turn off everything I can - so now you have a basic car for which you paid extra for the safety features that don't actually work correctly and if it doesn't work properly, it's a hazard to driving."

I've taken it to the dealer 6+ times over this issue and all I'm told is Acura is working on a software update. It's now a year later and no update. Sad that this issue takes away from what could be a great car."

I wanted a small SUV and I wanted a bit of an upgrade, after test driving many vehicles the Acura RDX seemed to fit what I needed. I've owned the vehicle for under two months. From the beginning, the sunroof will 'shift' when going over speed bumps/ changes in terrain on the road. The shifting is a loud POP- seeming to be the body shifting all the weight or stress of the car to the large opening of the sunroof. I took the car to Acura dealer, they were unable to hear what I was talking about. Car is still making the noise daily. The bigger, and more scary problem is that in the infotainment center gets fuzzy or makes popping noises (as described by others) the system goes black *EVERYTHING GOES BLACK* a message says network connection lost, and the whole system restarts. Important to note that you cannot control anything as far as navigation, music, radio, clock, change modes of drive, etc. I took the vehicle in to Acura, they said there was a system update and that the downloaded it and it should be better. The day after I got my car back, it started again. One day while on an 2 hour car trip, it restarted 26 times. My fiance and I started a betting game on how many times it would restart. Acura claims that this is an Apple issue, and they're waiting for an update from Apple. I do not believe this is the case, this happens when my phone is connected, when it's not connected, when it's plugged in, when nothing is connected and just playing the radio. In my non-car-knowing brain, I believe this is a heat issue. When my car is parked in the garage and cooler, or when I am driving at night- this seems to happen less or not at all. When it's been parked in the hot sun all day and the car is hot- that's when this happens. To me, this seems to be some sort of connection issue or heat issue, not an Apple issue as stated by the Acura car dealer. I plan to take my car back again to forcefully make them fix the car. Possibly return the car."

Other problems too numerous to mention - all of which happened randomly, which meant that the dealer (who made honest efforts to address the problems) was unable to duplicate.

The true touchpad interface got mixed reviews in many reviews I read, but I\u2019m finding the learning curve very short in getting a feel for using it. Only two things I would change about the car if I could: the button to turn off the Auto Idle Stop feature should let you turn it off completely, because the shudder when re-accelerating is annoying and the button resets each time you start the car. The second thing is: this car needs a change holder for coins for tolls, meters, etc. These are nit picky things, however, and the engineers nailed it with every other aspect of this car. The dynamic driving modes are great, the head up display is great, the engine is lively, the interior is ultra comfortable and plush. The cockpit puts everything ergonomically where the driver can easily get to it. My absolute favorite thing on the RDX - the 16 speaker surround sound stereo system. It\u2019s absolutely amazing and the best I\u2019ve ever heard in a vehicle. I highly recommend the 2019 RDX Advance!"

I leased it in November and to date (May 24, 2019) only have 5,890 miles on the car. My informant system completely shuts down and disabled all functionality -including Bluetooth. Shortly after this happens- electrical popping can be heard throughout my dashboard. If you can imagine the firework poppers that you throw on the ground? Yes- that is the exact sound that comes out of my dashboard for lengths of appx 20 minutes at a time. That\u2019s not scary at all, right? Electrical malfunction? I brought the vehicle immediately into the dealer on Monday, April 29 as I was extremely fearful of my safety. They had the car for the day and said that a hard reset of my car had to be done and it was ready for pick up. Tuesday, April 30th the informant system is down again and the popping is back....soooo now it\u2019s going back to Acura again for a second time. Acura has the car May 2-3 and has decided that the car has a faulty gauge control. A new part is ordered and replaced. GREAT! Until it\u2019s not great. Only two weeks later as I am in the middle of a 200+ mile road trip POP POP POP and there goes the system again with the sound back. My RDX is currently in the shop and they have been very transparent that they don\u2019t know what is wrong with it. My car has been in the shop for 9 days this month and I have lost complete trust in the vehicle itself and do not feel safe in it."

              "review_text": "This is a car with an identity crisis. It looks like a really fast car, yet it's really not fast and it's really not a luxury car. The engine is awesome but the transmission is horrible. With 10 speeds, it seems to have trouble making up it's mind of when to shift and when not to. Upshifts speeds are noticeably faster than downshifts but only if you are very deliberate with the throttle. During low to moderate speed driving, the car shifts all over the place just to keep you in the torque band, making for a very uncomfortable ride for a \"luxury\" crossover. And what's with the fake engine \"noise\" being piped through the speakers? The car is noisy enough on it's own. It's just obnoxious and it can't be turned off. Not going to add too much to the bad (and very slow) infotainment system or to the unreliable safety features that haven't already been brought up in other reviews. Overall, I would suggest anyone looking to buy this car, take it for more than a 5 minute spin before making a purchase. Take it around town for an hour and try some \"normal\" driving in traffic and see for yourself. Definitely try the lane keep assist and collision avoidance features and see for yourself if they seem helpful or just downright dangerous. After putting 6000 miles on mine, here's the good and bad in my opinion. Good: Great design work on the body and most of the interior. Strong engine - unfortunately mated to a bad transmission Great SH-AWD system. This thing is glued to the road. Chassis is very stiff and feels quite solid Bad: Horribly slow infotainment system (maybe due to the fact that it's a very old version of android). Horribly slow transmission and it shifts CONSTANTLY for no reason. Sound deadening in this vehicle is just subpar for anything trying to be labeled as a luxury vehicle. You can hear everything outside, but that's typical Honda. Silly engine note being piped into the speakers that you can't turn off. Leather on the seats feel cheap and so do the rest of the plastics and the seats are stiffer than they need to be Storage in center console could be better designed. To wrap things up - This car has been quite a let down since day 1. I've owned a lot of cars and this would be the first one that I really just don't like to drive. Maybe I'm expecting too much for $48k but I just think they could do so much better."

Pros: This car is really peppy as compared to our 6 cylinder 2016 TLX . The reviewer of this car did not like the new touch pad but I have to tell you, I love it. It is easy to learn and easy to use. So, younger people (I'm 75 years old and had the touch pad down pat in 3 days flat), get over it. The interior cabin is luxurious and despite the noise being a little higher than our previous TLX (see above), the ride is smoother. This vehicle is a SUV or shall I say CUV and is not supposed to be fun to drive except...........it is! Just put it into Sport + mode and off you go. The Adaptive Cruise Control and front/back camera sensors plus blind-spot monitoring is fantastic as is the Nav System; yes, the Nav system is great so when they finally do install Android Auto, we may not even use it.

I got around 25 - 27 around town and as much as 35 mpg highway on the 2016 but only 18 local and 23 hwy on a lucky day on the 2019. Ridiculous! The turbo 4, and 10 speed transmission coupled with auto shut off simply does not achieve advertised mpg. Changing drive modes - comfort or sport - does not make a difference. The push button transmission is manageable but not attractive. The 4 cyl. turbo does have enough zip although the turbo is a bit noisy. On the plus side the ride for the Advanced model is smoother than 2016 which had a ride that was too rigid/sharp over even the smallest rough surface. My general impression is Acura engineers have too much time on their hands needlessly spent trying to trick out this model. Interior space is more than ample but so was the 2016. Nevertheless it would have been better used by keeping the 6 cylinder which I believe shut down cylinders at cruising speed and prior transmission with much better mpg. The technology is nice but again over engineered. Whatever happened to \u201ckeep it simple\u201d?"

Infotainment system gives irrelevant warnings -- like \"no drive mode available\" when i don't even try to access it. BRAKE warning goes on even if nothing in front of me. I could go on. Acura Customer Service has had a case open since the vehicle was 2 weeks old and dangled buyback for months until I gave up and filed for arbitration a long 4 months ago. What a slow process. At this time all issues are fixed except the infotainment and random commands, and those present maybe 1/4 of the time I drive it and on final inspection, field rep could not duplicate. SO their response in writing is there is nothing wrong with the vehicle, it is safe, and has not lost value. I fear Acura/Honda will not do right by me unless at hearing the issue presents. I can only hope the 80 days out of service total will win me compensation. Florida Lemon says 30 days out of service so we shall see.....but no matter what, I will NOT keep the vehicle even if I take a huge loss. Two Acura dealers refuse to buy it back. A Honda dealer pulled up Carfax and questioned all the service visits (CarFax does not detail issues), and CarMax cannot even find my car in the system with the VIN. Huh??!!!

I average 14mpg and I know why. The transmission shifts at odd times leaving the engine to require Turbo constantly and bringing the MPG way down. Bar far the least efficient vehicle I have ever owned. I mean it is horrible. Speaking of transmission.. if you dare to start in sport or sport plus before warming up the car, the computer just redlines first gear. You basically have to paddle shift the gears or go back to D mode. But drive mode as I said, is where the MPG drops significant. Trying to find a setting or paddle shift gears to increase MPG is ridiculous. Navigation? Cannot tell you how many times I screamed at the voice navigation . Can\u2019t find xxxx and when it does you pretty much are at your destination or while driving went past the turn you needed to take. I mean.. the amount it takes to find a destination is like using an APPLE II LC vs and IMAC. It literally takes minutes to find a destination. I dont think it is a software issue as much as hardware. They probably skimped on a faster processor. No Excsue. Yes a fully loaded RDX is $10K cheaper than QS5, GLC AMG 43, or X5 M but the additional $10K is worth it in my opinion. They missed the mark on these failures and could of really penetrated the market if they paid attention to those enthusiastic drivers who would want to purchase this type of vehicle. Unless I see a significant improvement in a software upgrade soon, I am taking a loss and trading my Advanced for a Mercedes or Audi. Extremely dissatisfied. I dont see how the gas mileage will ever change unless they fix the gear ratios."

The handling and ride is excellent with the SH-AWD. Performance is very good, though not as good as my Acura TL (sedans)Type-S'. The audio system is awesome and the vehicle is very comfortable, even for 5 adults. It is no wonder Acura leads sales in this segment by a long shot."

I've read about \"piped in engine noise\" that many are complaining about. Is that the culprit? Or are Continental 19\" Tires part of the problem?

I have the RDX Advance, which adjusts the ride and it is more smooth and quieter than the other RDX models. I love the aggressive styling, performance, heads up display and ELS 3D stereo system. The only issue I have is the infotainment system, using CarPlay is a little glitchy, but they send over the air updates on a regular basis so it getting better over time. I am a tech guy and have no problem with cutting edge tech and RDX has more tech than most. Kudos to Acura!"

              "review_text": "I cannot begin to tell you how much I regret my decision to buy my 2019 RDX (Technology package). What was \u201clove at first sight\u201d has turned into a \u201chate at first month\u201d experience and this car is not living up to the Acura name and alleged \u201cquality\u201d at all. I am so disappointed and frustrated with this vehicle and was not expecting all the issues I\u2019ve had in the first 2 months of ownership. If I could take it back I would. Unfortunately for me I do keep my cars for a long time and with an expensive car like this one I\u2019ll be stuck with it for long time. The car is definitely great looking and stylish, but that\u2019s where my \u201clikes\u201d start and end. For the first month and a half of ownership I took it in 4 times, was in a loaner car for 1/3 of this time and now I have to take it in AGAIN because of other issues. I started having issues at 1,500 miles and I now have 2,000 with more issues. There are so many flaws with this car, but before I go into the actual issues that required and still require trips to the dealership, here are a few general complaints: - The FM radio drives me NUTS and that\u2019s because you never get consistent sound. There is this \u201cHD\u201d signal that goes in and out when you drive and when that happens not all of the speakers work so the sound goes from loud to low and vice versa and it comes through different speakers as well. It is SO ANNOYING that I can\u2019t listen to my favorite radio stations at all. You do have the option to turn off \u201cHD\u201d and only play analog, but when you do that you don\u2019t get sound from the 12 speakers that they brag about so much. So what\u2019s the point of that many speakers if you can\u2019t get them to play the sound??? Sorry Acura, but my 12 year Toyota Yaris had better radio sound than this. - The lane departure feature entails an orange light that pops up on the dash. How exactly is a \u201clight\u201d supposed to effectively get the driver\u2019s attention if they \u201cdepart the lane\u201d due to a distraction? Have they not considered adding an option for a sound? Yes, you shouldn\u2019t expect a car to replace driver\u2019s common sense, but a light certainly doesn\u2019t \u201cassist\u201d with anything. - The car did not come with all weather mats and the Acura ones suck. I had to buy Weathertechs, I also had to buy a rubber mat for the trunk, etc. How do you pay mid 40\u2019s for a car and don\u2019t get basic mats? My best friend purchased an Outback a month before I purchased my car and for a car that was two thirds of the price of mine, she got EVERYTHING included \u2013 rubber mats, retractable trunk cover, etc. I\u2019d rather pay more and get it all instead of feeling nickled and dimed. - Remote start did not come manufacturer installed and you have to order it separately OR you can pay an arm and a leg for a useless app. Why? Again, if the car was in the $20-$30 K range that\u2019s fine, but these cars are not cheap. - Infotainment system is HORRENDOUS \u2013 trying to write with your finger or type is a nightmare. I hate everything about the infotainment system and I will leave it at that. - I don\u2019t care as much about the mileage because I bought the car for the performance and style, but I wanted to point out that the \u201cmileage\u201d that was published for this car was pulled out of thin air \u2026 19 mpg has been my max. So here is a list of the things that I have taken my car in for and will be taking it in again this week: 1) Infotainment system not working \u2013 I would get the blue disclaimer screen that would stay on at all times even when I stopped and locked the car. My husband had to pull a fuse so my battery doesn\u2019t die overnight. I have also had the infotainment screen go completely blank for days. I\u2019ve taken my car in twice for this issue and they still don\u2019t have a permanent fix. The Service Manager even joked and told me that if it happens again at least I know which fuse to pull. Excuse me, I did not pay an arm and a leg for a car to pull a fuse at 1,500 miles, this is not what I signed up for. 2) Auto stop/start \u2013 after I picked up my car from the dealer when I took it in for the screen issues, I now have and hear this loud awful clunky sound when the car re-starts. In addition, the auto stop/start engages whenever it feels like it. I took the car back to the dealer, but they couldn\u2019t reproduce the sound at that time so I\u2019m stuck driving a car that makes this loud noise when the auto stop disengages. 3) Break sound \u2013 my car now makes this awful break noise when I release the breaks after coming to a full stop."

              "review_text": "It\u2019s what I get for buying a first run of any car. The engineers apparently didn\u2019t do a lot of real world testing before rolling it out. In the first 1500 miles I\u2019ve found a lot of gripes with this vehicle with only very few accolades. Beginning with the driving dynamics, the 10 speed transmission along with the vetch turbo engine shifts at awkward points during average driving which leads to a busy and jerky ride. Not bad when you deliberately mash the throttle on a straight line run, but during start stop traffic it kind of sucks. With 280 ft/lbs of torque, I don\u2019t know why it would want to ever downshift to its lower gears once the car is moving but it often does. Feels like driving your car into a pond of water. Add that to the fact that this is the slowest dual clutch trans I\u2019ve ever felt, it\u2019s just not a pleasant experience. Speaking of slow, just shifting from park to drive or from reverse to drive is a couple of second peicesss. I don\u2019t know if it needs to think about it first or what... And what\u2019s up with the lane keep assist? Only works at 45mph and above, so listen for the beep when you hit any sort of traffic as it will just turn off. Not that it works that great anyways. The system seems to only make corrections every few seconds so it\u2019s kind of all over the road. Maybe they should have put more sensors in that giant Flava Flav emblem in the grill? Collision mitigation also doesn\u2019t work well. I\u2019ve never seen it do anything other than beep. Doesn\u2019t stop or slow down the car at all. Not sure if this is intentional or if it just doesn\u2019t work correctly. The sound system is just okay. I expected better from the Premiim ELS 16 speakers but the lack of sound dampening in the car almost negates all benefits of having the 16 speakers. Kind of like trying to listen to your favorite music on your $10,000 home stereo while your dish washer is running in the background. The lack of detailed control over the sound just adds insult to injury. Bass, Trevble, Mid, and fader - that\u2019s all you get from the \u201cpremium\u201d sound system? Throw in an EQ or something plz... Beyond the sound quality, the overall basic functionality leaves a lot to be desired. It takes a loooooong time to boot up, and when it does, it starts up at the volume where you left off. So if you had the music turned up loud when you exited the vehicle, it will be turned up just as loud when you get back in and it eventually boots up. So jump in your car, start the engine, and 20 seconds later you get a nasty surprise left by whoever was driving it before you. Most other late model cars allow you to set a fixed start volume but this \u201cpremium\u201done doesn\u2019t have this feature. Finally, the system is not very passenger friendly unless they are good at working a mouse pad with their left hand. Even the volume knob is on the drivers side. The power windows CAN be rolled l down from the keyfob remote but they CAN\u201dt be rolled back up without getting in the car. Why not? Most other cars can do both.. Alot if cons with this vehicle but there are some pros as well. Yes the 10 speed transmission totally sucks but the engine makes up for it. It really is powerful when in its torque band and it is pretty smooth for a 4 banger. The car appears pretty solid so far as well. No creaks or weird noises so far (other than a lot of road noise) so the quality control isn\u2019t bad. Love the SHAWD system as it seems to really give the car tons of grip. The torque vectoring happens in the background invisibly but effectively. I am truly hoping that Acura offers some updates to this vehicle. Nearly all of the issues above should be fixable via a software update. Acura, if you are listening - reprogram the shift points, program the lane keep assist to update its location more frequently. add some features to the ELS software, program the ELS to allow a fixed start volume, reprogram the car to be able to roll the windows back up via the remote, add some sound deadening to subsequent models. Do this and you\u2019ll have yourself a winner!"

              "review_text": "After months of researching and shopping, pulled the trigger on new RDX w/Tech... After driving it for 3k mi in 2 mo, here are my impressions. THE GOOD 1. The leather seats are very soft and comfortable. Beats any latest model Nissan, Volvo or BMW. The real leather is exquisite. Acura makes the best leather seats, period. Better than the latest Volvo XC90 or XC60, BMW X3 or 3 series, Nissans and even Hondas and Audi Q5... The only seat that is better is the one in Volkswagen Passat, but these are synthetic leatherette... The seat is 16-way power adjustable, and on Advance trim it has power thigh extension as well... Love the seats. 2. The ELS 3D Studio premium audio system is sublime. The surround sound is fantastic, and is second only to Volvo's latest Bowers & Wilkins audio system. 3. The style. I really, really love the body styling if the new RDX. It is elegant, agresive, sporty, modern. I really love the 19\" shark gray wheels. The cabin is modern, luxurious and I would say, elegant. Love panorama sunroof. 4. Comfort and ride. Very quiet cabin, supple ride. Good rear legroom and headroom 5. Cargo capacity. Is on par with any compact SUV, and is better than almost all luxury compact SUVs. 6. Price point. Very competitive guven the amount of features. 7. Engine power and torque. With 272 hp on tap and low-RPM 280 lb-ft of torque, this SUV has a pick-up of a sporty sedan or a hatchback. 8. Handling. With its wide stance and low profile, coupled with torque-vectoring all-wheel drive, this SUV corners flat, and can handle any curve confidently, feeling sure-footed on any type of pavement. THE BAD 1. Transmission. Acura keeps telling us (since the crappy 6-speed in 2013 RDX and 8, and then 9-speed ZF transmission in Acura MDX 2013-2015, 2016-2019) that they are going to finally fix the rough and jerky gear shifts, especially at low speeds and going uphill, and finally they claimed that they did it with the Honda-engineered 10-speed transmission, debuted in the 2018 Honda Odyssey, and now in 2019 RDX... But let me tell you, this tranny, although much better than 9-speed German-made ZF and the 6-speed in old RDX, still has some serious issues: at low speeds it tends to keep in the middle gears (3-6), instead of downshifting to 2, perhaps--I don't know, but the effect is as if it is in higher gear at lower speeds than it should be, preventing acceleration at speeds at around 25-30 mph, or when coasting to a stop light or parking... This is very annoying, since the vehicle feels underpowered for simple maneuvers, like coasting to a stop light or driving in a parking lot. Pushing the throttle, simply jerks the vehicle forward, as if accelerating from dead stop, which is not what one wants, and is dangerous in traffic or parking garages... Disappointing. 2. Fuel economy on premium 92 grade gas. In the mixed mostly city driving I average only 21 mpg on premium gas. Very disappointing. On regular 87 octane gas, the fuel economy drops to 20 mpg. Disappointing... 3. Small fuel tank, short driving range on a full tank. With only 17 gallon tank, maximum I can drive on premium gas on a full tank is 300 miles, before the fuel gauge light up. Very, very disappointing... My Nissan Rogue would go 359 miles before I had to stop for refueling... 4. Infotainment system. Very, very glitchy and underbaked. Using the precision touch mouse pad is awkward; using navigation is clunky. Voice recognition barely works. The loading of contacts takes a very, very long time... Calls are driooed every now and then; the system hangs intermittently... Nissan's simple Bosch-designed infotainment puts Acura to shame... Android auto is not supported as of yet... No way to look up point of interest phones; no Pandora or Google integration. My Nissan had all that. I miss Nissan's infotainment system. THE UGLY 1. The brake pads already squeal on all 4 as if completely worn out on a brand-new vehicle with less than 3k miles! 2. Passenger wiper is not retracting completely. This is a calibration issue, which Acura is looking into. 3. The hatch back-door creaks and moans on opening and closing, just like a whale. 4. Driver vanity mirror cover squeaks when opening. 5. The cargo area liftable cover does not stay open, and needs to be held while accessing the underfloor storage compartment. 6. To put in roof-rails and crossbars, Acura is asking for $1,200. Very expensive for almost a necessity on a SUV. CONCLUSION Do not recommend buying."

This one is THE biggest disappointment and worst experience I have ever had with a new vehicle. From the day I drove it home with 7 miles on it to currently having 450 miles it has been one thing wrong after another. It first started with sounding like a loud creaking floor anytime you go over a bump or dip in the road. That progressively got louder and worse as it began happening around turns and mostly smooth roads. Then driving down the road doing nothing trying to change anything with the Dynamic mode, the computer started flashing and glitching with a message stating: Drive mode change unavailable. Interior brake pedal squeaks every time pedal is pushed. Drivers seat squeaks every time it moves forward or backward. Rear brakes sound like metal on metal when in reverse and as I was taking to the dealership for repairs for the 2nd time in less than a week it started sounding like I was pulling a chain behind me hitting the asphalt. NEVER have I ever purchased a brand new vehicle that has had problems. I feel like I have just purchased my first used car with everything going wrong with it. It has now been in the shop for 3 days and they have replaced the sway bar and bushings 2 different times, done an alignment and it is still making the sound and they have no idea why. So for the month that I have owned it, has been in the shop for 5 days and ongoing, who knows when I will get it back and at this point I don?t want it back. Do yourself a favor and wait a year or 2 until they get all of the problems figured out with this new model. It is not worth what you pay for the hassle you will inevitably get."

The problem is severe especially when it's cold. I tried warming up for 5 minutes before leaving and the problem was not observed. So this vehicle requires warming up as most of vehicles in 80s or 90s did. But remember you're buying a so-called luxury vehicle paying more than 40 grand in 2019. This is really hard to reproduce at dealer because by the time I arrive at dealer, the vehicle is already warmed up and once it's warmed up the vehicle runs smoothly during the day. Another issue is this 2019 RDX is gas greedy, usually I can get a little less than 23 mile/gallon but it requires 92 octane recommended. When I'm spending money for high-end luxury version with high priced octane gas and low mileage, at least I didn't expect rattling rough transmission. Do not buy 2019 RDX, you'll regret and waste your money."

I called the first dealership and they said Acura knows about this issue and they do not have a fix or an estimated time for it. I then called Acura corporate and they asked me to contact another dealership. I contacted a second dealership (Hoffman Estates) and they scheduled an appointment with a loaner car. When I got there they did not have a loaner available (sorry is all I got) and then without looking at the car said it was a normal sound from the brakes. I have now called Acura corporate twice and a case manager is going to assist. This is the first Acura I have owned (previously owned Infiniti and Lexus along with other non-luxury cars) and this is a first with this type of poor response. A similar post with brakes I saw on this blog was from: New Design Issues by florida guy from Palm Beach, Florida on Wed Oct 24 2018"

Love the styling, free revving engine, acceleration, quick shifting 10 speed transmission, great steering and handling. The adaptive shocks are great smoothing out long rides in comfort mode and firming up in sport and sport+ on the windy back roads for a fun ride. Interior is upscale with lots of room in the front and back seats. and good storage in the rear. After 3000 miles of driving, the only negatives I have found are the auto engine stop and navigation. It can get annoying, especially in traffic. You can bypass the auto engine stop, but it reverts to on at every start of the engine. The navigation has had some problems finding places and addresses, while Google and Apple maps have not. If you input an address and save it, you cannot add a name, which means you need to know what a saved address is, not good. I love the console and the touch pad and audio system. It's easy to use and makes for a safer drive. After a few tanks of gas, I saw the gas mileage increase. I am currently getting 27.8 mpg on the highway and about 25 mpg on mixed city and highway and 22 city."

              "review_text": "I purchased the 2019 Acura RDX A-SPEC FWD. I have owned this car for a little over 2 months. Here is my long winded, but honest review. Currently obsessing: - The red seats and dark rims give the car a custom feel without the custom price tag. - Brake hold ? This allows you to put your car in a breaked position without having your foot on the break or putting your car in park. This is super handy in a drive through line or stop and go traffic. - Air conditioned seats ? These have been really nice on hot day or when leaving the gym. - Screen ? The screen is a nice size and I like the split screen so that I can see the GPS and whatever I?ve listening to at the same time. - Pano roof ? yes just yes! - Automatic rear door ? loving that I can open and close with the touch of a button. - USB ports ? up to 4 people can charge their phone at the same time and it seems to charge my phone very quickly. - Voice activated GPS ? I like the ability to say the address to the car rather than typing in and I have not had issues with the incorrect address popping up so far. - Apple car play messaging ? the car can read you a text and reply for you while driving. - 2 keys ?my husband is almost a foot taller than me so I love that we each have our own key so that the driver seat will adjust accordingly. You can turn these off and they will stay off thank goodness: - Lane departure ? found this more annoying then helpful. - Auto high beam ? there is a function that automatically turns your brights on at night in certain scenarios. If you live in the city you should 100% turn this off. Wish it didn?t exist: - Start/Stop Engine ? always turns off at the most inopportune times for me. Typically, when I am at a yield needing to get on a service road quickly the engine turns off so this creates a few second delay which obviously can be a problem. There is a way to turn this off however this resets whenever the car is turned off. - Dynamic mode ? seems like a waste of space. I changed my car to comfort mode during the first week and felt this gave me more control while driving. I have not touched the feature since then. Issues: - \"System error ? function unavailable\" - I?ve received this message multiple time when clicking through my preset stations on my steering wheel when in XM. Once this happens you can only manually go through stations one by one. **One solution that has worked for me is to use the touchpad to click on one of the preset station icons on the XM screen. I have found I can click between my presets on the steering wheel again. - The A- Spec Model Does not have a spare tire Additional Information: - Gas Mileage - I do about an even amount of highway and city driving and get a consistent 25 MPG, so I am filling up about once a week. I have done about 4 road trips and have not seen the MPG improve. - Touch pad ? took a while to get use to, but it's fine once you get used to it. - Button gear shifter - this was easy to get used to for me. I will say because it is a button on occasion I forget to push the break when changing between gears, more specifically, in the car wash. - BRAKE ? when you get to close to someone your car will flash a break warning and even slow your car down automatically. This can be handy if you?re not paying attention. - Side sensors ? these are handy while driving and parking, but annoying when pulling in/out of garage or at a carwash. - Distance pacing cruise control ? this can be annoying if someone suddenly changes lanes but it?s nice for the most part. I keep mine at one car length and adjust based on weather. - Hidden trunk storage - I have used a few times. I once stored a nice camera and tripod (about 2 feet or so long) in here. If you wanted to use a trunk cover, you only have about a foot or maybe a little more for height on items because of this compartment. I would rather have a deeper trunk space with trunk cover over this hidden compartment. Overall, I am really enjoying this car!"

For three years we have been looking for a replacement for my wife's 2006 Lexus RX 330. The options were narrowed down to the XC-60, QX50, RX and the RDX. The XC-60 was eliminated on price and the fact that not only is Volvo Chinese owned, but the vehicles currently in the US are made in China. The QX50 was eliminated on price and a dated interior with a very cheap sliding cover for the center storage area. We drove the RX and the RDX within the same hour. The RX didn't demonstrate one advantage over the RDX, and was over $8K more. The front end styling of the RX also didn't help it. We have yet to feel any situation in the RDX where we wished for more power. The new True Touchpad is unique, but it takes less than 15 minutes to adapt to it and is superior. I was able to program the primary home screen so that 98% of the functions my wife will use are available with one touch. The voice control for the navigation has been flawless so far. With part of the money we saved, our dealer added the 20\" diamond-cut wheels to top off its good looks. My wife is hard to please, and one minor detail can kill a deal. She loves every feature of the RDX so far. Any complaint has been remedied with the options available for most functions. Its floating center console design provides more side leg room and storage than any of its competitors. With its top safety rating added to the fact that the RDX was designed in California and Ohio and is assembled in Ohio with 60% North American parts, we have no regrets."

While interior seems more refined, the second gen V6 is a lot quieter and more comfortable than this third gen i4. The noise level is simply unbearable and only a few racer may like the idea. It is bad business decision that Acura listened to the few car magazine reviewers who mostly are sport racing oriented. The success of second gen RDX was mainly due to the majority of day to day driver wants quiet and comfortable ride. I was at the dealer test driving this model and within an hour, there were three couples asking for the second gen. 2018 RDX. All of them stated pretty clear there is no way they would fork $45K for an i4 turbo, and they hadn't even tested drive this noisy third gen. I haven't seen one 2019 on the road while the dealer parking lots were loaded with 2019 model you can tell the new third gen is a big mistake and products are not flying off the shelf."

Worst part is, it lost all power and steering while we were driving just past Atlanta GA. We were 3 lanes in and had to battle in heavy traffic to get to the shoulder of the road while cars were zooming past. It was terrifying. We had 1300 miles on it. We just took it on a business trip. Accura road side service told us we didn?t have road side service and told us they could help us find a tow truck and the cost was $250 about. We were stranded due to no car rentals in the area having any one way vehicles. We missed our meeting. We stayed overnight and heard nothing. I called Acura for help with the mess and even escalated the issue up in accura as high as I could and they didn?t help us. I was told this death trap of a car was our problem. A 2019 RDX with 1300 miles that we bought less than 3 weeks earlier was our problem. They would cover the warranty and fix it but that was it. This vehicle has too many glitches and I would advise against it and also say that Acura was horrible to buy from. The lot did end is helping us and we worked out a trade for an MDX 2018. Hopefully it?s a good car for us. I wish we would have stayed buying from Ford and the Lincoln brand."

The SUV just wants to be driven fast. With the SH-AWD and tightened steering, this SUV is a dream to drive on highways especially on curvy highways and twisty roads. The SUV styling is a hit. It is also fairly large SUV, if not the largest, in its class. The infotainment is very good, but not spectacular. The 16 speaker ELS Audio is very good, but not mind-blowing. But it will more than satisfy all but the hardened audiophiles. It still sounds better than at 80-90% of systems out there. The main downside is that the car only does around 19 MPG combined which is significantly lower than advertised. Granted, 70% of drives have been local. Highly recommended. Pros: 1)High reliability and resale value. 2)Low maintenance costs. 3)Roomy and comfortable interior, especially the seats. 3)Fast and sporty. The SH-AWD is simply awesome on twisty roads at high speeds. 4)Precision handling especially at highway speeds. 5)Quick and extremely smooth shifting 10 speed. It is hard to tell if the SUV is shifting at all. 6)Very quiet interior. 7)Can store lot of cargo, especially below the cargo area. 8)Exterior and interior styling is a hit. 9)Chassis is 38% stronger than previous version and I can FEEL it. This is rock solid SUV. 10)16 speaker ELS Audio is very good. It will satisfy all but the audiophiles. I have personally found the default setting to the best (and I tinkered with it for hours). Cons: 1)19 MPG combined is less than advertised and disappointing. 2)I can't permanently shut off auto engine stop/start feature. The feature automatically turns on after engine start. 3)The auto engine stop/start is sort of clunky. The engine starts takes little longer than its competition."

Great overall styling, an excellent interior, and packed with the latest tech that Acura used to be know for. That would be good enough, but the value for dollar equation hits it out of the park. The performance with SH-AWD is sports-car-like, especially in Sport+ mode. I wish there was a hybrid, or better mileage overall, but that's one of the few weak spots in a very well executed CUV that's the right size and price, and holds up well next to competitors at $10,000 more."

Going to a 6 was hard for me and the 4 cylinder never impressed me. However, although I loved my 2016 RDX I loved the looks of the 2019 but never thought the 4 cylinder would work for me. I was seriously wrong. I had poor expectations and all I can say is when I drove this 4 cylinder it was EXCITING!! Two hours later I owned one! I am not an impulsive driver and I did my homework before purchasing the 2019 Advance model but I test drove a Tech Model. I am sure the base model is just as impressive to drive but I couldn't resist the Advance Model for its beauty, sound system, and the few extra's for comfort above the Tech model. All I can say is test drive one and you Will Definitely buy it if you are in the market for a mid size SUV although this one is a lot larger than its predecessors. It beat the Lexus, BMW, Audi , Stelvio & Mercedes in the same category and I test drove them all. The infotainment system took me 2 days to customize and get the feel of it. It looks intimidating but it is relatively simple and the best voice recognition I've experienced yet. Voice recognition for everything is so good I rarely take my eyes off the road or use the touchpad. Its that good! The touchpad is also easy to use without taking your eyes off the road. Heads up display has a lot of options with apps. Another reason not to take your eyes off the road. To sum it up... WOW!! Acura you've truly made an amazing vehicle and all I can say is Thank You!!! You all involved in this vehicle deserve a lot of Credit! I have never written a review in my life and I have owned a lot of cars but this car needed to be written about! If you don't put this car on your list, you are truly missing out on a Fantastic Vehicle!!"
